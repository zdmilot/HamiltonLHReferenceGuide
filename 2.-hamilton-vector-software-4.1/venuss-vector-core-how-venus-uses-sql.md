<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (168).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This infographic showcases the efficient utilization of vector backbones in Hamilton liquid handling systems like VENUS and NIMBUS platforms. The vector backbone provides core functionalities such as Run Control, Labware Editor, Liquid Class Editor, and Method Editor. VENUS uses vector files to control both STAR and Vantage platforms, ensuring precise execution of workflows and enhanced pipetting control with Vantage's advanced capabilities.

The utilization of the SQL server and the server commands are aimed to keep this vector up to date for each installation. See [prepare-the-vector-database.md](prepare-the-vector-database.md "mention") for more information about setup of this database.
