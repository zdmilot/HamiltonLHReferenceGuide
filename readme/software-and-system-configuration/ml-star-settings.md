# ML STAR Settings

## Barcode Settings

The “Barcode settings” allows:

* Selection of a plate to assign the barcode to if multiple plates are on the same carrier position
* Enabling or disabling of the generation of a barcode trace file (C:\Program Files\HAMILTON\LogFiles\barcodes\_N.txt)
* Selection of the barcode types which are allowed on the instrument

The storage location of the barcode is dependent on the operating system and the language settings.

## Communication Settings

The “Communication settings” Header is only active if “instrument” Mode has been selected. In “Simulator” Mode, there is no communication port to select.

## Instrument Configuration

The following can be selected in the “Instrument configuration” Menu:

* “Automatic locking of front cover” Option
* Check for free deck position before a carrier is loaded
* “Default waste” location (accept the default for new methods)
* Speed up cLLD detection (remember liquid height) if sample tracking is enabled
* 1000μl-pipetting channel to teach labware positions
* 5ml-pipetting channel to teach labware positions



## Maintenance Settings

The maintenance procedures can be enabled here. The user of the system is periodically requested to execute the preventative maintenance. Hamilton recommends switching on the maintenance control in order to ensure that the system works reliably. The maintenance procedures are described in the ML STAR Line Operator’s Manual.

## Simulator Settings

“Simulator configuration” allows the selection of the built-in option with which the simulated instrument should run. Make sure that the devices to be used by the system are activated (“Available”) in the simulation configuration to simulate a method without any error messages.



## Step Selection Settings

The “Step selection” Section allows the including or excluding of Single Steps in the method editor toolbar.

With VENUS M Software, the TADM test aspiration pressure curves are analysed to indicate pipetting performance.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
