## TIMING AND INFORMATION&#x20;

The consumables officially launched in January 2022. Change information and notifications, as well as validation reports for tips, accessories and technology are available upon request.&#x20;

1\. Will current CO-RE tips continue to be available following this launch?&#x20;

* Upon release of the CO-RE II consumables, there will be a transition phase. After current CO-RE stock has been consumed, only CO-RE II tips will be available.&#x20;

2\. What is the official date for the hardware launch?&#x20;

* The tentative hardware launch date is July 2022.&#x20;

3\. Will wide bore and specialty tips also be produced with CO-RE II technology?&#x20;

* Yes, all CO-RE tips that use 1000 μL independent channels and 96 MPH will be CO-RE II compatible. Tips for 5 mL channels and 384 MPH are not affected by this change and will remain the same.&#x20;

4\. Do the CO-RE II tips have a new part number?&#x20;

* No, part numbers will not change.&#x20;

5\. Will there be a new revision number for CO-RE II tips?&#x20;

* Yes, Hamilton (US) revisions will be updated to Revision K, and Hamilton Bonaduz AG (Switzerland) revisions will be updated to Revision 50.&#x20;

6\. Can current tips and CO-RE II tips be used in the same run?&#x20;

* Yes, with current CO-RE stop disks. Once the hardware is updated to CO-RE II technology, users will then only be able to use CO-RE II tips.

&#x20;

## COMPATIBILITY

7\. Is there an error which appears if I use current CO-RE tip with CO-RE II stop disk?&#x20;

* There is no error message that appears. However, it has to be noted that CO-RE tips paired with CO-RE II will not seal properly and may leak.

8\. Are CO-RE II tips compatible with CO-RE stop disks?&#x20;

* Yes. Backwards compatibility of the tips with the legacy version of the stop disk is guaranteed. However, once stop disks have been changed to CO-RE II, legacy tips must not be used.&#x20;

9\. What if I have large quantities of CO-RE tips in stock and the stop disks on the system are changed to CO-RE II hardware?&#x20;

* Hamilton will work with users over the next year regarding hardware timing changes to ensure that existing legacy CO-RE tips are consumed.&#x20;

10\. Can my system be retrofitted with legacy CO-RE stop disks?&#x20;

* Customers will not be downgraded to legacy CO-RE technology.&#x20;

11\. Who is liable for lost samples/reagents if wrong tips are loaded on the instrument and the system is leaky?&#x20;

* The end user is responsible for ensuring the correct tips are used with new CO-RE II technology.&#x20;

12\. How can an end user distinguish the two different technologies?&#x20;

* CO-RE II tips are clearly labeled on the outside of the case box, blister pack cover, and have “C2” printed on the tip rack barcode label. Additionally, CO-RE II stop disks are easily identified by the red O-ring as pictured in Figure 1. Legacy stop disks utilize a black O-ring.

&#x20;

## VERIFICATION&#x20;

13\. What verification testing will be available to show evidence of CO-RE II pipetting performance?&#x20;

* The CORE® II Tip Validation Summary Report confirms backwards compatibility of CO-RE II tips with current CO-RE stop disks are available upon request.\
  \
  A test summary document for CO-RE II stop disk and their affected environments will be available for distribution spring 2022.

&#x20;

## RISK MANAGEMENT DURING CO-RE II TRANSITION

14\. What is Hamilton’s backup strategy in the event of production startup issues with CO-RE II consumables?&#x20;

* Hamilton has extensively tested CO-RE II tips to mitigate startup risks. In the event of errors, Hamilton can produce both legacy CO-RE and CO-RE II consumables as a short-term solution.

SPECIFICATION

15\. Will racks, barcodes, and tip numbers change?&#x20;

* Racks, barcodes, and tip part numbers will not change, except for C2 designation on the tip rack label. Blister and case labels will now indicate CO-RE II.&#x20;

## SERVICING

16\. Have any tests been performed to improve service interval expectations?&#x20;

* Several duration tests conducted during the CORE® II Technology Validation Summary Report have been completed to exhibit CO-RE II stop disk and tip longevity. Tests that were run to confirm enhanced lifespan of up to 500,000 cycles with proper maintenance.

17\. Have tests been run to demonstrate lifespan impact on current customer performance?&#x20;

* No. However, extensive testing has been performed to demonstrate O-ring durability.

18\. Is validation necessary before customers switch from CO-RE to CO-RE II stop disks?&#x20;

* There are Validation Protocols provided by Hamilton For the In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) environment, re-validations may be necessary. Hamilton has published Performance Verification Reports proving that there is no difference in pipetting performance between CO-RE and CO-RE II technology. For the IVD environment, re-validations may be necessary. Should re-validations be necessary, these are the responsibility of the end user.

19\. Are there any customer costs associated with the change from CO-RE to CO-RE II technology?&#x20;

* Customers will not incur costs for hardware changes made before July 2024. Any changes after July 2024 will incur costs. Additionally, any re-validations costs are the responsibility of the end user.

20\. Will there be updated service instructions and manuals for CO-RE II?&#x20;

* Service instructions and manuals for CO-RE II will be updated upon hardware release.

21\. What is the replacement interval for CO-RE II hardware?&#x20;

* CO-RE II stop disks are expected to last throughout the hardware lifespan. Hamilton does not foresee replacement.

22\. Should replacement only be performed by Hamilton, or by the end user(s)?&#x20;

* O-rings can be replaced by the end user(s). Instructions will be provided prior to the hardware launch. Periodic calibration and verification must still be performed by Hamilton Field Service Engineers.

23\. Is there more information on the use of a torque tool installation?&#x20;

* CO-RE II stop disks include a 2 mm hex on the distal end to aid installation. The installation torque for a CO-RE II stop disk is 12 cNm.
