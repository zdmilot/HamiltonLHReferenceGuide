##  Arm Components

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Channels" %}
Channel sizes are 1000uL or 5000uL. They independently move in Y and Z directions. Channels are numbered from back to front to match the orientation of plates and sample tubes. The minimum distance (raster) between 1000ul channels is 9mm – same as the distance between wells on a SBS format 96 well plate.

On 4-and 8- 1000ul channel-instruments, every channel reaches every well on the deck . The more channels added, the less of the deck that is fully reachable by all channels.

The ML STAR uses an internal X-Y-Z coordinate system with the Origin (zero position) located at the bottom left front 100mm below the deck surface

{% tab title="CO-RE 96-Probe Head" %}
Contains 96 x 1000μl Channels that all work simultaneously pipetting the same volume.

Picking up a single row or column of tips, or a single tip is possible when using the tip rack adapter.

Because the 96-Probe head is attached on the left of the X-Arm, it cannot reach the right most deck positions

## Deck Components

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Autoload" %}
Loads and unloads carriers from Loading Tray to deck and back. The unit moves along the X-axis and uses a Carrier Presence Detector to confirm a carrier’s presense. The purpose of the autoload is to read barcodes from carriers, plates, and tubes as the gears pull the carrier onto the deck Barcode Reader rotates 90 degrees to be able to read both tubes and plates

{% tab title="LLD" %}

pLLD - Pressure based liquid level detection for all liquids. pLLD only works with new empty tips during aspiration of liquids

{% tab title="MAD" %}
## Monitored Air Displacement

During the aspiration process, the pressure within the pipetting channel is measured in real time. Analyzing the shape of the pressure curve provides the STAR with the ability to distinguish the following situations:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (398).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Monitored Air Displacement (MAD) monitors aspiration of a liquid in real time. The automated liquid handler’s software monitors the pressure curve during aspiration to detect errors in aspiration, like clots, foam, and lack of liquid.&#x20;

Using MAD during the aspiration, pressure changes are monitored for the following attributes:

* Pressure increase/spike due to aspiration of air&#x20;
* Pressure decrease due to aspiration of clot. The pressure drops below a lower clot threshold indicating a clot was detected.&#x20;
* Minimum pressure difference between the start and the end of the liquid transfer

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (23) (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<details>

<summary>When to Use</summary>

* MAD is optimized for aqueous solutions and unused disposable tips.
* MAD should be used when aspiration monitoring is needed, and dispense monitoring is not.&#x20;
* MAD is best used as a general process control as its monitoring can cover a range of aspiration volumes. TADM can only monitor specific volumes.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>When Not to Use</summary>

* If complete aspiration and dispense monitoring is required, use TADM instead of MAD.&#x20;
* If tips are re-used or needles are used for pipetting, MAD may not perform consistently as it could generate intermittent “false” improper aspiration errors.&#x20;
* If a recording of the pressure curve needs to be made, it is not recommended to use MAD. MAD only stores the most recent aspiration pressure curve on the channel board. It is only accessible through the use of the Hamilton Service Software and therefore is only meant for troubleshooting purposes.&#x20;
* If using liquid types other than aqueous solutions, the use of MAD may not be optimal.&#x20;
* If the aspiration volume is below 50 μL, the default threshold values may need to be adjusted and tested with real liquids.&#x20;
* If using low aspiration volumes 10 μL or lower, the pressure difference may be too minimal for MAD to work properly.

</details>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="TADM" %}
[Total Air Displacement Monitoring (TADM)](../../6.-advanced-method-programming/total-air-displacement-monitoring-tadm.md) monitors aspiration and dispense of a liquid in real time. The pressure sensor in the channel is used during both aspiration and dispense steps to detect errors, like clots, foam, and lack of liquid. Upper and lower tolerance bands can be established and monitored for exception.&#x20;

TADM can be used in two different modes:

* **Recording mode:** The pressure inside the pipetting channel is recorded and stored.&#x20;
* **Monitoring mode:** The recorded pressure is compared to a user defined tolerance band in real time. If the measured value leaves the tolerance band, the plunger movement stops immediately and the software-dependent error handling is executed. In Monitoring mode, the recorded pressure curves will be stopped after last defined TADM tolerance band point.

</div>

<details>

<summary>When to Use</summary>

TADM should be used if both aspiration and dispense monitoring is required. TADM is optimized for unused disposable tips during:

* Single aspirations and dispenses for volumes above 10 μL.&#x20;
* Multiple dispenses for individual aliquot volumes above 10 μL.
* Transfers of various liquid types. TADM is not limited to the use of aqueous solutions only.

It is possible to use TADM with used disposable tips and washable steel needles, but success with these tip types depends on the consistency of their generated pressure curves. Residual liquid from used tips and residual wash fluid from steel needles could cause some irregularity in the pressure curves, making it a challenge to set meaningful guardbands.&#x20;

TADM is especially useful for regulated environments and development purposes since a recording of every transfer step is made. The recording of the pressure profile allows the automated liquid handler’s operator to review and compare the pressure profiles of liquid transfers during and after a method run. The recordings can be helpful in troubleshooting if the profile is not stable or some transfers show atypical behavior.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When Not to Use</summary>

* If the volume to pipette is less than 10 μL, TADM may not be able to be used for monitoring as the pressure profiles for low volumes may not be consistent.&#x20;
* If you need to determine the pipetted volume, TADM cannot determine the volume.&#x20;
* If you need to determine how much volume is missing from a sample, TADM cannot determine this volume.&#x20;
* If you need to make a statement on trueness and precision, TADM cannot confirm the precision of the transfer.&#x20;
* If variable volumes are transferred in the method, it may not be practical to create tolerance bands for every possible volume. The volumes could still be recorded, but not monitored for exception.

In the scenarios listed above, TADM doesn’t offer a benefit or might not even be possible to implement. A method using TADM should be tested for maximum repeatability and robustness to ensure proper transfers before putting TADM into regular use.

{% tab title="Clot Detection" %}
The STAR measures the capacitive signal as the tip leaves the liquid after aspiration.

The system expects the signal to change as the tip leaves the liquid and reaches a certain height.

If the signal remains constant, that indicates a clot is sticking to the tip

This mode is independent of MAD

{% tab title="ADC" %}
## Anti-Droplet Control

Continuous monitoring of pressure inside barrel detects minute increase in pressure (red line)  &#x20;

When pressure reaches point where dripping is likely, plunger is withdrawn to keep liquid inside tip and prevent dripping (blue line)  &#x20;

Used for volatile liquids with extremely low viscosity and high vapor pressure like Acetone and Methanol
