* Always consider tip waste contaminated. Handle and dispose properly.
* Do not place hands in the way of moving parts. Use Good Laboratory Practices and Universal Precautions.
* Wear suitable Personal Protective Equipment.&#x20;
* Do not switch tubes around after processing has begun.&#x20;
* Perform test runs with water before using actual fluids and samples.&#x20;
* Validation of methods is the responsibility of the laboratory.&#x20;
* If pipetting aggressive liquids, use filtered tips.&#x20;
* The STAR should be shielded from direct sunlight or intense artificial light.&#x20;
* Do not reuse tips that have been discarded into the waste.&#x20;
* Do not empty the tip waste while the instrument is running.&#x20;
* The use of an uninterruptible power supply is recommended.&#x20;
* Never disable any security measure.
* Do not leave tips or needles on the pipetting channels for extended periods (such as overnight).&#x20;
* Guard against software viruses.&#x20;
* Running other applications while the STAR is running may adversely affect the operation of the STAR.&#x20;
* Low volume (10ul) tips do not reach the deck or the bottom of sample tubes in standard sample carriers.&#x20;
* Nothing on the deck should sit higher than 145mm above the deckâ€™s surface.
* The front cover is equipped with a magnetic switch which is monitored during a method run.
