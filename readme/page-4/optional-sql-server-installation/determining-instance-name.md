# Determining Instance Name

In the event that the SQL Server database has already been created and you want to try using the existing database to connect to VENUS, you can find the database name in the Computer Management screen. However, to use an existing database, you would need to know the administrator account (‘sa’) password, have another administrator’s credentials, or have the local user on the list of accessible accounts for the database and use Trusted Connection.
