# Water Displacement

Tecan, a leading company in laboratory automation, offers a range of liquid handling technologies, including the Liquid LiHa (Liquid-Handling Arm) and the Air LiHa. These two systems are designed to provide precise pipetting solutions in automated workflows, but they operate using fundamentally different principles. This report will delve into the workings of both the Liquid LiHa and the Air LiHa, highlighting their technical differences, strengths, and the contexts in which each system excels.



## Tecan Liquid LiHa: An Overview

The Liquid LiHa system is a liquid-displacement pipetting module designed to offer accurate and precise liquid handling in automated workflows. It is primarily used in Tecan’s Freedom EVO and Fluent workstations. The Liquid LiHa operates using positive displacement technology, where the liquid is displaced by a piston within a syringe, ensuring precise volume control.



### Key Features of Liquid LiHa

• Positive Displacement Mechanism: Unlike air-based pipetting systems, Liquid LiHa relies on direct contact between the piston and the liquid. This direct displacement ensures more accurate liquid transfer, especially when handling viscous or volatile liquids.

• Wide Range of Pipetting Volumes: The Liquid LiHa can handle a wide variety of volumes, making it suitable for both low-volume and high-volume applications. Typical volumes range from sub-microliters to milliliters, allowing flexibility in experimental design.

• Compatibility with Diverse Liquid Types: Since the system relies on direct piston displacement, it is less affected by the properties of the liquid, such as viscosity, surface tension, or vapor pressure. This makes it ideal for handling liquids like glycerol, ethanol, and DMSO, which can be challenging for air displacement systems.

• Minimal Cross-Contamination: The use of disposable tips or washable fixed tips in the Liquid LiHa minimizes cross-contamination risks. This is crucial when working with sensitive or infectious samples, as well as in high-throughput environments where sample integrity is critical.



### Applications of Liquid LiHa

• Viscous Liquids: Liquid LiHa is especially useful for pipetting highly viscous liquids, such as glycerol, which would be difficult to handle using an air-displacement system.

• Sensitive Assays: It is ideal for applications that require precision and accuracy, such as PCR setup, genomic assays, and ELISA, where even small pipetting errors can lead to significant experimental variability.

• High-Throughput Environments: Given its robust design and ability to handle a wide range of liquid types, Liquid LiHa is frequently used in pharmaceutical research, biotechnology labs, and clinical diagnostics, where large volumes of samples need to be processed quickly and accurately.

## Technical Differences Between Liquid LiHa and Air LiHa

The primary difference between the Liquid LiHa and Air LiHa lies in their mechanisms of action. This difference has significant implications for the types of liquids they can handle and the precision and accuracy they can achieve.



### Pipetting Mechanism

• Liquid LiHa: Uses a direct piston-driven system (positive displacement) where the piston comes into direct contact with the liquid. This ensures precise volume control, particularly for challenging liquids like viscous or volatile compounds.

• Air LiHa: Utilizes air displacement, where an air column is used to aspirate and dispense liquid. This mechanism is well-suited for handling non-viscous liquids but can be less precise when dealing with volatile or viscous substances.



### Sensitivity to Liquid Properties

• Liquid LiHa: Since the piston directly displaces the liquid, this system is less sensitive to variations in liquid properties like viscosity, surface tension, or volatility.

• Air LiHa: More affected by the properties of the liquid. Highly viscous liquids can cause inaccuracies due to the compressibility of air, and volatile liquids can evaporate into the air column, reducing pipetting accuracy.

### Maintenance and Consumables 

• Liquid LiHa: Typically requires more maintenance, as the system relies on complex mechanisms that may need regular cleaning and calibration. The use of washable fixed tips also necessitates more involved maintenance procedures.

• Air LiHa: Easier to maintain due to its reliance on disposable tips, which reduces the need for cleaning and minimizes the risk of cross-contamination.

\


### Accuracy and Precision

\


• Liquid LiHa: Offers higher precision and accuracy across a wide range of liquid types and volumes, making it ideal for sensitive applications where even small pipetting errors can lead to significant results variability.

• Air LiHa: Provides good accuracy and precision with aqueous solutions but may struggle with accuracy when handling liquids with challenging properties, such as high viscosity or volatility.

## Selecting Between Liquid LiHa and Air LiHa

When choosing between Liquid LiHa and Air LiHa, the specific needs of the laboratory and the types of liquids being handled should be considered.\


### When to Choose Liquid LiHa

• Laboratories handling a diverse range of liquid types, including viscous or volatile compounds, would benefit from the precision and flexibility offered by Liquid LiHa.

• Applications requiring high accuracy and minimal cross-contamination, such as in genomics or proteomics research, are well-suited for Liquid LiHa systems.

• High-throughput environments that need reliable pipetting of challenging liquids would find Liquid LiHa more suitable.
