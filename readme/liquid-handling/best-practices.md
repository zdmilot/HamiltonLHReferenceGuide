# Best Practices



## Low Volume

### Method Settings

* Use 50μL Tips
* Single dispense if possible
* Use surface empty mode
* Keep distance between tip and pipetting surface minimal without blocking the tip
* Liquid following turned off

### Liquid Class Settings

* May require increase in settling time
* Slow swap speeds
* Increase blowout volume on aspiration, but minimize on dispense
* Prevents capillary effect by creating an overpressure



### Touch Off (From Bottom)

* Maintains consistent distance from bottom of well
* Can be used in the aspirate or in the dispense step

### Side Touch

* Dispense at the side of the container wall
* Side touch height is defined within the container definition

## Multi-Dispensing

### Method Settings

* Use as many pre- and post-aliquot volumes as possible
  * Some liquids may require 2 pre- dispenses
* Limit total number of aliquots per cycle
* Pre-wet the tip on first aspirate
* Use “minimize z-move step”
  * Set dispense height equal to the clearance height

### Liquid Class Settings

* Increase stop flow rate to match dispense flow rate
* Use a small stop back volume (dry dispense only)

## Serial Dilution

### Method Settings

* Use a new tip for each transfer
* Dispense to surface if possible
* Mix very well before and/or after each transfer
  * Mix at a fixed position
  * If using LLD and liquid following, a properly defined labware is critical
  * Mix volume should be less than 80% of total volume in the well
* Be mindful of retract distance for air transport if dispensing at fixed height

### Liquid Class Settings

* Depending upon dilution factors, different liquid classes for each step may be required
* Remove over-aspirate volume parameter
