# Digital Inkjet Dispensing

Digital inkjet dispensing is a technology that enables precise, non-contact liquid handling in the range of picoliters to microliters. it offers accuracy, flexibility, and scalability for various applications, including life sciences, drug discovery, materials research, and 3d bioprinting.

Non-contact microdispensing systems offer accurate and high-throughput deposition of bioactive fluids for many biological and life science applications. The high uniformity and small size of piezoelectric droplet generation makes the technology desirable for creating micro features for high throughput analysis, fabricating precision microstructures and depositing materials in MEMS and BioMEMS devices that cannot be achieved by other means. Ink-jet based deposition is flexible, requires no tooling, is non-contact, and is data-driven, as the printing pattern is created directly from CAD information and stored digitally. As an additive process with minimal waste, it is economical and environmentally friendly. Ink-jet printing technology can dispense spheres of fluid with diameters of 15-200µm (2pl to 5nl) at rates of 0-25,000 per second for individual on-demand droplets. Piezoelectric dispensing technology is adaptable to a wide range of material dispensing applications, such as biological reagents, biomaterials, and biocompatible polymers.

#### Fluid properties considerations

The general fluid property requirements for a fluid to be used in a piezoelectric demand-mode ink-jet device are as follows: Viscosity = 0.5-40cp (Newtonian); Surface Tension = 20-70 dynes/cm. Fluids with properties outside these ranges may be dispensed using ink-jet devices, but with increased difficulty / decreased performance (see figure to the right). The left image of the figure shows an unstable inkjet microdispensing associated with high frequency deposition of a low surface tension, low viscosity solvent. The right image presents a stable inkjet microdispensing obtained using a higher surface tension and higher viscosity fluid at the same frequency. Combinations of the extreme values may also have poorer performance. If the fluid is heated or cooled, the above properties are required at the orifice. The viscosity and surface tension values described are appropriate for fluids with a specific gravity near 1. For high-density fluids, such as molten metals, the values above should be converted to kinematic values using the density of water. Newtonian behavior is not strictly required, but the fluid properties at the orifice flow conditions must be in the above range. Thus, as shear thinning fluid could have a low shear rate viscosity much higher than the 40cp. Viscoelastic behavior causes significant performance problems. Fluids properties can be modified to better match the demand-mode ink-jet requirements by changing the concentration of solute and/or solvent or by adding viscosity and surface tension modifying agents, such as glycols, glycerin, alcohols and surfactants.\

Particle suspensions are acceptable as long as the particle / agglomerate size and density do not cause the suspension to depart from the fluid properties range given above. Particles that are >5% of the orifice diameter will cause at least some instability in drop generation behavior, but still may be acceptable in low concentrations. However, problems associated with the particles settling out during microdispensing idle time may occur.

Fluids containing polymeric and proteinaceous components may exhibit problems with the material drying and filming over on the orifice during idle time between dispenses. Such filming over may result in dispensing failure or drop instability. Corrective methods include increasing the relative humidity in area adjacent to the orifice, decreasing the concentration of the polymer or proteinaceous material, adding humectants to the fluid (glycols, glycerin) or using higher boiling point solvents.

MicroFab has dispensed a wide variety of biologically relevant fluids and reagents as presented below.

#### Biocompatible polymers

Biopolymer microdispensing has applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery, such as creation of cell attachment sites, scaffolds for tissue engineering, and coatings and drug delivery systems for controlled drug release. Polymeric materials can also be dispensed to create and/or modify solid support structures, such improving adhesion / wetting or repulsion / non-wetting at very high resolution.

#### Biofluids / Bio-inks

Ink-jet microdispensing can be used to accurately deposit biological fluids, ranging from single molecules (proteins, DNA, lipids) to tissue extracts and cells. Because these biological relevant fluids are dispensed by ink-jet they are often referred to as bio-inks. For example, human serum has been microdeposited for the purposes of Western Blot analysis. Cells have been microdispensed into wells for drug screening assays and for cell seeding and patterning in tissue engineering applications. DNA and proteins have been dispensed to create gene and protein expression, immunoassay and diagnostic microarrays. BSA and other blocking agents (casein, non-fat dried milk, other animal serums, commercial formulations) can be printed to selectively block areas on a membrane or other substrate. Lipid microspheres for drug delivery have also been created using inkjet microdispensing. In addition, lipids have been microdeposited onto solid substrates to selectively control location of cell attachment to the substrate.

#### Active molecules

Active components can be incorporated into a 3D matrix for tissue engineering applications. Materials, such as collagen, laminin and extracellular matrix can be microdeposited to create bioresorbable scaffold structures for implantation. Growth factors (nerve growth factor, connective tissue growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, etc.) can be incorporated into these microdeposited matrices to stimulate cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation, orientation and migration patterns. For example, piezoelectric microdispensing offers a method to create concentration gradients of growth factors for controlling neurite growing patterns in nerve regeneration scaffolds. Further examples of active molecules dispensed by ink-jet technologies are given in the reagents section.

The inset on the left shows spots (200-300um in diameter) that have been treated with the inkjet microdeposition of trypsin to obtain a micro-scale digestion of the protein spot of interest. A matrix material is then inkjet microdeposited onto the spots after the micro-scale digestion is complete. The protein blot is then transferred to a MALDI-TOF MS instrument for analysis in the process of peptide mass fingerprinting for protein identification. Multiple endoproteinase digestions can also be performed on the protein spots of interest in a similar manner. The use of a second protease not only independently confirms the proteins identity, but the combined peptide mass fingerprints increase sequence coverage. More information can be found in the Chemical Ink-Jet Printer (ChIP) brochure.</em></p></figcaption></figure>
