# Levels of Liquid Handling Automation

### 1. **Manual Single-Channel Pipettes**

Manual single-channel pipettes are widely used for single-point workflows and small-scale projects in research and development. They provide flexibility, which is crucial in workflows such as cell culture, where precise liquid handling may not be as critical as the movement of liquids, such as aspirating supernatants or transferring small volumes.

Example Workflows:

* Analyzing a single sample using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.
* Developing assays with varying conditions, like serial dilutions for an ELISA assay.

While manual pipettes offer flexibility, they pose a higher risk of human error, especially in high-throughput environments where tracking well positions in 96-well plates can become challenging.





### 2. **Manual Multichannel Pipettes**

Multichannel pipettes increase workflow throughput while maintaining a low cost. These tools are ideal for plate-based assays, like total protein or BCA assays, where distributing reagents quickly and accurately is crucial.

**Example Workflows:**

* Plate preparation for BCA assays or DNA quantification assays.
* Low-throughput mixing operations where precise visual control is needed.

However, they still carry the risk of human error, especially when attention to detail may wane during repetitive tasks.

### 3. **Electronic Single-Channel Pipettes**

Brands like Integra Biosciences, Mettler Toledo Rainin, and Eppendorf provide electronic single-channel pipettes. These devices offer programmability for repetitive tasks, such as creating standard curves or conducting precise dispensing in multi-step assays.

**Example Workflows:**

* Standard curve creation for qPCR or ELISA assays.
* Precise multi-aspiration or dispensing tasks for small molecule screens.

While they improve reproducibility, electronic single-channel pipettes do not keep track of which wells need liquid, which can lead to missed wells or over-pipetting in some workflows.

### 4. **Electronic Multichannel Pipettes**

Electronic multichannel pipettes automate multiple simultaneous aspirations and dispensations, which reduces human error and increases efficiency in plate-based workflows.

</div>

**Example Workflows:**

* Preparing 96-well or 384-well plates for assays like high-throughput screening (HTS).
* Automated reagent addition for a multi-step ELISA assay.

These systems also come with programmable settings for precision, but like their single-channel counterparts, they do not track samples well and can generate bubbles if aspiration is overdone.





### 5. **Robotic Pipette Conversions**

Devices like the Integra Assist Plus or Waters Andrew Pipetting Robot convert manual or electronic pipettes into semi-automated systems, enabling increased walk-away time and repeatability.

**Example Workflows:**

* Automated standard curve creation or serial dilutions.
* Automated reagent addition for small assays with repeatable processes, such as DNA extraction or library preparation for sequencing.

These robotic systems are limited in capabilities, as they cannot track liquid levels or manage complex workflows, but they provide a good balance between cost and performance.





### 6. **96/384-Channel Stamping Pipettes**

Devices like the Integra MINI 96 and Rainin MicroPro are critical for adding reagents simultaneously across many wells. These are ideal for expediting processes where uniform reagent addition is needed, such as media addition or plate washing.\

</div>

**Example Workflows:**

* Media addition in high-throughput cell culture workflows.
* Reagent dispensing for assays like BCA or Bradford assays.

These devices are great for specific use cases but have limitations when it comes to flexibility or complex workflows.





### 7. **96/384-Channel Robotic Arms**

Devices like the Integra ViaFlow or Benchmark AutoMATE use robotic arms to move liquids across multiple samples simultaneously, offering increased speed and semi-automated workflows.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (809).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Example Workflows:**

* Addition of time-sensitive reagents like HRP in an ELISA.
* Simultaneous liquid transfers for BCA or cell proliferation assays.

These systems provide uniform and reproducible reagent addition, making them ideal for labs with higher throughput needs.





### 8. **Multi-Axis Liquid Handlers**

Devices like the Agilent Bravo or Formulatrix F.A.S.T. feature multi-axis heads and multiple deck positions, allowing automation of complex assays with added flexibility for integrating peripherals like shakers or sealers.

**Example Workflows:**

* Automating multi-step cell culture workflows.
* High-throughput drug screening with varying concentrations.

These devices offer the ability to automate full assays while maintaining flexibility in terms of different volumes and liquid handling needs.





### 9. **Automated Liquid Handling Robots**

Automated liquid handling robots have the capability to provide single channel and multichannel pipetting in one device. these can also include options such as plate grippers, 96/384 well stampers, and may also allow for integrated devices such as thermocyclers, plate shakers, etc.&#x20;

* Assays where sample tracking is crutial such as where samples are barcoded and need to be kept track of for end point analysis and association of data

These workcells provide full walkaway time usually and provide reproducibility, making them the pinnacle of liquid handling automation.





### 10. **Fully Integrated Workcells**

Fully integrated workcells such as HighRes Biosolutions or Automata combine multiple devices into a cohesive system capable of executing end-to-end workflows. These systems allow for liquid handling, plate washing, reading, and other assay-related tasks to be linked seamlessly.

**Example Workflows:**

* High-throughput screening (HTS) with integration of liquid handling and detection systems.
* Complex cell culture assays requiring multiple liquid handling steps, incubation, and detection.

These workcells provide maximum walkaway time and integration allowing for them to be crutial in an automated laboratory utilizing liquid handling automation.
