**dynamic devices - lynx**

dynamic devices' lynx automated liquid handler uses volume verified pipetting (vvp) for precise and independent volumetric control in multi-channel pipetting. it offers high throughput, large volume handling, and eliminates liquid class optimization. lynx's real-time measurement of each transfer ensures unmatched accuracy and reduces errors.
