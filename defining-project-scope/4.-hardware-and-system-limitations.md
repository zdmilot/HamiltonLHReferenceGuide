Automation engineers must understand the physical and budgetary limitations of their systems. If new hardware is required, plan for future integrations to save time and money in the long term. Ensure that all equipment and tools can be seamlessly integrated into the automated workcell.

* **What hardware limitations should be considered?**
  * Are there constraints on pipetting channels, plate movement, deck space, or integrations? Is budget a limiting factor for new hardware purchases?
