# 13. Mixing and Agitation Requirements

Many assays require mixing steps. Pipette mixing can often replace mechanical shaking, reducing deck space and simplifying the automation setup. This helps streamline the workflow and reduce the number of components involved.

* **Does the assay require mixing?**
  * Can titration (pipette mixing) replace the need for shakers, reducing the need for additional equipment?
