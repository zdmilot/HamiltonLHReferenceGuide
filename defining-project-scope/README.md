  Prior to any programming, it is important to understand what the project needs
  as much as possible. Avoid making assumptions which could lead to wasted
  effort and time.

# Defining Project Needs

## Review the System Configuration <a href="#review-the-system-configuration" id="review-the-system-configuration"></a>

Review the system configuration and discuss with the pre-sales team or system owner. Identify any key features, project commitments, and personal training gaps with respect to the product configuration or included devices. Communicate and address these gaps with management and colleagues.

## Review the Requirements <a href="#review-the-requirements" id="review-the-requirements"></a>

Consider each requirement for the workflow. How will the deck be set up? What is the step- by-step process for completing the method? These questions will drive how the method is programmed. The following factors should also be considered, even if they are not explicitly covered in the project’s requirements:

* The required throughput compared to the system’s capacity
* Any access restrictions caused by the system configuration that could limit the process or increase the complexity of the method – for example, systems with more than 8 independent channels cannot access all locations on the deck, which is not always captured in the software
* The volumes used, and the minimum corresponding number of tips, reagents, and other consumables
* Assay parameters such as timing and temperature
* Identify any gaps in the training or knowledge required for programming the method and consult subject matter experts for assistance when necessary.

## ‌Collect Required Labware <a href="#collect-required-labware" id="collect-required-labware"></a>

Collect the input, output, and intermediate labware required for the method. Use existing labware definitions whenever possible; create new definitions only if necessary. Minimize labware usage whenever possible, even if multiple labware of the same type are available.

## ‌Identify Liquid Types <a href="#identify-liquid-types" id="identify-liquid-types"></a>

Make a list of all liquid transfers in the method. This includes not just the liquid type and volume, but how and under what conditions it will be pipetted. Determine which transfers can use existing liquid classes, and which transfers (or liquid types) will require liquid class development.

**If liquid class development is required, then allocate the appropriate amount of time and tools to complete the task.**
