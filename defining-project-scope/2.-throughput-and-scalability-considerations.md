# 2. Throughput and Scalability Considerations

Automation thrives in environments where high sample throughput is required. When dealing with larger sample sets, consider automation that supports "walk-away" time, ensuring that a machine can handle large volumes without constant supervision.

* **What is the expected throughput?**
  * How many samples are processed per day, week, or month? What is the breakeven point where automation makes sense?
* **Is there a plan for scaling up?**
  * Can the workflow scale from small-scale to large-scale production without significant changes to the process?
