# 8. Sterility and Contamination Prevention

In some assays, sterility is paramount, requiring the use of disposable tips or single-use labware. However, there are strategies to minimize resource use (e.g., adding reagents before samples) to optimize tip use without compromising the integrity of the assay.

* **What sterility requirements are there?**
  * Are single-use tips necessary to prevent cross-contamination, or can tips be reused
* **Does the order of reagent addition matter?**
