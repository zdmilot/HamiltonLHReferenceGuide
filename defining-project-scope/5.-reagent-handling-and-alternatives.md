# 5. Reagent Handling and Alternatives

For high-throughput automation, reagents play a critical role. Assess reagent storage conditions, stability (light/air sensitivity), and format availability (liquid vs. powdered). Reducing reagent costs and ensuring compatibility with automation systems is key to achieving consistent, high-throughput results.

* **Are there alternative sources for reagents?**
  * Can high-throughput, inexpensive reagents be sourced to minimize dead volumes and costs?
* **Can the transfer volumes be increased to optimize multi-dispense methodologies?**
* **Are lyophilized or powdered reagents available in aqueous forms?**
* **What are the storage conditions for each reagent?**
  * Are reagents sensitive to temperature, light, or air exposure?
* **Are custom reagent containers needed to fit within the automated workflow?**
