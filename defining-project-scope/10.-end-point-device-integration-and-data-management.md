# 10. End-Point Device Integration and Data Management

Ensure that end-point devices, such as plate readers or analyzers, can be integrated into the automated workflow. If off-deck devices are used, plan for efficient data export and analysis methods. Data management is key to ensuring the traceability of samples and results.

* **What is the end-point device for the assay, and can it be integrated into the liquid handler?**
* **What file formats are required for output (e.g., plate maps)?**
