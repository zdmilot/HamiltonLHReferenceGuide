# 9. Manual Intervention and User Notifications

Automation should minimize manual interventions, but some steps may still require human input. Implement robust notification systems, such as emails or text messages, to alert users when the system requires attention or when a process is complete. Hamilton systems, for example, support email notifications for both non-urgent and urgent alerts.
