# 12. Deck Layout

Custom carriers and flexible deck layouts can enhance the versatility of automated assays. Plan for changes in deck configuration and consider additional modules (e.g., plate hotel or output modules) to optimize throughput and streamline workflows.

* **Does the deck layout need to change between assays or during the assay?**
  * Is plate "hotelling" or input/output modules needed?
