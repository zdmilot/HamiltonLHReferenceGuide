# 1. Understanding the Purpose of Automation

Automation should be purpose-driven. Automating for the sake of convenience is rarely justified, but improving precision, throughput, or consistency often makes automation worthwhile. Clearly define the success criteria, such as reduced error rates or increased efficiency, so everyone understands what "success" looks like.

* **Why automate?**
  * Define the primary goal of automation. Is it to reduce human labor, improve accuracy, enhance throughput, or a combination of factors?
* **What pain points are being addressed?**
  * Are there specific areas of the assay that are challenging or inefficient when run manually (e.g., high variability, labor-intensive steps)?
