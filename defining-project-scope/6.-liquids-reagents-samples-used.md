# 6. Liquids/Reagents/Samples Used

Understanding the properties of the liquids used is crucial for ensuring safety and selecting the correct materials for tips and labware. Toxic or corrosive chemicals may require special protocols or the use of resistant materials to prevent equipment damage or contamination.

* **Are there any toxic or corrosive chemicals involved?**
  * Determine if special handling or containment is necessary, including the use of special materials for tips and labware.
* **What liquid types are being used?**
  * Identify the types of liquids (e.g., aqueous, organic solvents, viscous liquids) and whether they require any special considerations for pipetting, storage, or disposal.

**Additional Steps:**

* **Make a detailed list of all liquid transfers in the method.**
  * Include not just the type of liquid (e.g., buffers, reagents, solvents), but the volumes, transfer conditions (temperature, speed), and whether the pipetting can use standard liquid classes or requires development.
* **Assess liquid class development needs:**
  * For transfers that fall outside standard protocols, allocate time and resources for developing and validating custom liquid classes to ensure accurate and precise handling.
