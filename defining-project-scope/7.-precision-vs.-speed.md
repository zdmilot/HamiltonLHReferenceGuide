# 7. Precision vs. Speed

Different assays have varying needs when it comes to precision versus speed. For example, Hamilton platforms offer different dispense modes, such as "dispense on the fly" for rapid processing, but this may not be suitable for high-precision applications. Tailor the automation method to the assay's specific goals.

* **Is speed or precision more important for this assay?**
  * Does the assay require ultra-precise dispensing, or is rapid throughput a higher priority?
