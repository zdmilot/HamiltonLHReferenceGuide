# Other Useful Sensor integrations

1. Liquid level due to ultrasonic sensor to make sure that there is enough liquid to do a liquid handler run
2. use cameras to have an automatic updated tip count
3. use tip counting checks within your liquid handling program to make sure there is enough tips for the run to compleete, for example venus by default does not do this and allows the run top cmmense even if there are not enough tips
4. use cameras for error detection and prevention
5. use cameras for deck layour information
6. humidity sensors, lux sensors, temperature sensors to monitor microenvironment within the liquid handler enclosure
   1. temperature is critical to monitor especially when heated devices are used on deck as enclosure temperature can be increased if there is non-sufficent air flow
7. sensors such as door close sensors can be utilized for safety
8. sensors for wattage or power draw can be used to verify equipment is running properly, it can also give information on device utilization over time
9. sensors such as infrared or magnetic based closure sensors can indicate when devices doors are closed such as with an ODTC or with a centrifuce allowing additional error checking using inexpensive methodologies
10. temperature probes within liquids can be used to ensure that the sample is at the exact needed temperature especially when using heater shakers on deck
    1. infrared temperature sensors can be used as a deck addition to be able to monitor specific liquid temperatures on deck as well
11. air flow sensors can be used for ensuring a HEPA filter or a safety enclosure stays constantly running espeically when cell culture or sterile workflows are used.&#x20;
