## [Custom dialog timeout](https://labautomation.io/t/custom-dialog-timeout/3033)

Is there a way to give a custom dialog a timeout? Similar to what can be given to a user output/input dialog.

In ASWStandardDialogs there are, if its any helpâ€¦

Timeout functionality has been added to the default custom dialogs in VENUS 6. It is not available in previous versions.
