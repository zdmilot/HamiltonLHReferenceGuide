There are two parts that compose an item in the “Events” tab.

2. Trigger – end user action during run time that initiates a designated \

   1. Checked/Unchecked: Used in radio buttons or check boxes refers to activation/deactivation of the element.
   2. Click: Used in buttons, radio buttons, or check boxes.
   3. Mouse Enter/Mouse Leave: Rollover, or cursor movement which enters/exits the selected element.
   4. Selection changed: Used in Drop down list, activates if the selected item from an array is changed.
   5. Text changed: Used in Text input, activates if the characters are modified.
   6. Value changed: Used in Numeric input, activates if the number is modified.
   7. Path changed: Used in Path input, activates if the file path is modified.

    1.  Event Actions\
        The type of Action available during a given Event is dependent on the element you have selected. For example, a button element has 15 different Actions that can be performed, while an image element only has 6.\


        In general, the Event Actions offer the same modifications available in the properties tab for a given element – color, font, visibility, tool tips etc.\
