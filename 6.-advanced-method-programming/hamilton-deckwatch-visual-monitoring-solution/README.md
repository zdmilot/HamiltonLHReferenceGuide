## Step 1: Understanding the Need for Deck Monitoring

Errors during an automated run can disrupt workflows, leading to delays, additional resource consumption, and frustration. In many cases, tracking these errors manually after the run has finished can take significant time and manpower. This is where **Hamilton Deck Watch** comes in—a camera-based solution designed to monitor all processes on deck in real-time, allowing for the quick identification of problems as they arise.

* **Problem Identification**: Detect issues like missed pipetting steps, incorrect labware placement, or collisions.
* **Time Savings**: Reducing post-run troubleshooting by spotting errors immediately or reviewing footage of the run.

## Step 2: Camera System Setup and Installation

The **Hamilton Deck Watch** system is designed to be quick to install and easy to use. The standard package includes two cameras that provide full coverage of the deck, allowing you to view the system from multiple angles.

* **Quick Installation**: Setting up Deck Watch takes minimal time.
* **Comprehensive Coverage**: With just two cameras, you get full visual monitoring of the entire deck, ensuring no part of the process is missed.
* **Ease of Use**: The system is user-friendly and designed for seamless integration into your existing automation workflow.

## Step 3: Benefits of Deck Watch Monitoring

Once installed, the **Deck Watch** system allows users to monitor their Hamilton system while performing other tasks. This offers flexibility and peace of mind, knowing that the system is being monitored in real-time without requiring constant supervision.

* **Background Monitoring**: Run the system while focusing on other tasks.
* **Efficient Error Detection**: If an error occurs, use the video footage to identify the issue quickly. This avoids prolonged system downtime while trying to troubleshoot.

## Step 4: Error Identification and Reporting

Errors like labware transportation failures can be immediately identified using **Deck Watch**. This reduces the time spent diagnosing problems after the fact, as the system records and logs the run for future review. When an issue arises:

* **Error Reporting**: Simply send the error trace files and video footage to the technical support team.
* **Fast Troubleshooting**: Hamilton’s technical service department can quickly pinpoint the issue using the provided data, minimizing operational downtime.

## Step 5: Remote Access and Privacy Management

The **Hamilton Deck Watch** system offers flexible control with remote access options. You can manage the live view, recorded footage, and system settings from any point within your network. This enhances accessibility and ensures that issues can be handled promptly from anywhere.

* **Network Accessibility**: View live feeds, recordings, and system settings remotely across your network.
* **User Management**: The system allows for robust user access management, ensuring that only authorized personnel can review recordings or modify settings.
* **Privacy Zones**: For labs that require privacy controls, individual privacy zones can be configured to protect staff privacy rights while still ensuring oversight of the deck.

## Step 6: Enhancing Automation with Deck Watch

Adding the **Hamilton Deck Watch** to your automation system ensures that you get the most out of your workflow, with peace of mind knowing that potential issues will be flagged and addressed in real-time. By continuously monitoring processes on the deck, you can focus on other tasks while ensuring that your system is running smoothly.

* **Peace of Mind**: Know that the system is continuously monitored, reducing the risk of undetected errors.
* **Maximize Efficiency**: Keep your automation running smoothly with minimal oversight.
