Right clicking in any Venus method you will see the option to insert HSL command. This often overlooked option will allow you to write commands in Hamilton System Language (HSL) which is basically C. You can use these HSL commands to perform advanced math, string concatenation, and log file traces without the need of added libraries.

One thing to note that new variables created in HSL commands will not automatically be declared so youâ€™ll need to open up the Variables list and add those variables or only use already defined variables.
