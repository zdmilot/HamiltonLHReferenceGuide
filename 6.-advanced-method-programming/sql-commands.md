An app specialist writing methods in Venus should strive to be somewhat familiar with SQL. Of course you can connect a method to a SQL database through the File commands but that isnâ€™t the end of their usefulness.

When using File commands there is an option for a command string. This string is a SQL query which can be used to filter the input files for just the pieces of data you care about.

For example running a File: Open command to read in a .csv which contains data on four different barcoded plates. You could write a SQL query for just the barcode you are currently interested in and then only read in the results of interest.
