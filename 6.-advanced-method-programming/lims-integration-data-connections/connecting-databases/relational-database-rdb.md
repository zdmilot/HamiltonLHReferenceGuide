# Relational Database (RDB)

Important concepts about Relational Databases:

* All data is stored in tables and tables are given names (ex. Job table)
  * Attribute = data column
  * Tuple = data row = record
  * Table created from query = result set
* Rules can be established for each attribute (Domain Integrity)
  * AUTO INCREMENT, NOT NULL, VARCHAR(15), INT, BOOL, etc.
* Tables should store same type of data (Data Normalization)
* Data tables “relate” to one another via Primary and Foreign Keys
  * Primary keys can be used to establish distinction (Entity Integrity)
* Keys can maintain relationships between tables (Referential Integrity)
* Users can create queries at run-time that group separate data tables together using these primary/foreign key relationships.
