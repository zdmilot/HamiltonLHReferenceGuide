Generating sequences when creating a deck layout isn’t the only way to do so if you have this library installed. For operations like cherry picking where you don’t know the containers you want to select until after the layout is created this library is essential. If you create the sequence ahead of time then you would need to use complex logic to keep changing the start and end points of the sequence to skip the wells you don’t want to interact with.

Using the sequence library allows for you to create a sequence on the fly with only the desired wells included which significantly simplifies writing methods in Venus.
