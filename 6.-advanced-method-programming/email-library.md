Venus can send a user an email in the event of an error if you turn on the option in the configuration but with this library you can create a step which will send a message to a user when you deem it necessary. An email could be triggered after or before certain steps (incubation, long cherry pick, end of method, temperature sensitive reagent needs adding) to enable the end user to leave the lab while the method runs and return when their intervention is required.
