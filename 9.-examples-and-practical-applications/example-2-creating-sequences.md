# Example 2: Creating Sequences

1. Combine the first column of all four 96-well plates into one sequence: Save as Column1x4&#x20;
2. Combine all 4 96-well plates into one sequence: Save as Platesx4&#x20;
3. Combine all the A12, C12, E12, and G12 wells of the four 96-well plates: Select Apply Stamp Tool to re-sort ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (124).png>). Save as Odd\_Blanks&#x20;
4. First 8 positions of first Reagent tub (save as Reagent\_A)&#x20;
5. Single position sequence on the first 96-well plate consisting of: A2, C2, B3, D4, C5, E5, A9, and B10. Save as Pick\_List&#x20;
6. Make a 384-well plate sequence that processes the four quadrants: A1-B1-A2-B2 using the 96 Head : Save as Quad384\_by\_96
