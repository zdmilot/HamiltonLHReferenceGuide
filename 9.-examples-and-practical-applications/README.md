# 16. Venus Programing Examples

Most of the instrumentâ€™s day-to-day operations will be driven by methods, so it is important that these are correctly defined and are at the same time easy to operate.

Storage of Methods

Programmed methods are stored in the methods sub-directory on the hard disk. They can be opened, edited and saved either in the graphical Method Editor or in the text-like HSL Method Editor.

Purpose of this Section

This section is a step-by-step approach on how to program a number of simple methods which are normally used in laboratories. Following these steps will help in becoming familiar with the layout and how the software works. Modifying the suggested methods to suit particular requirements or programming new methods based on what is suggested can then be done.
