# Example 1: Create new Method and Deck Layout

1. Create a new Method and call it Basic\_Deck, save it to the location “C:\Program Files (x86)\HAMILTON\Methods\Training\_YourNameHere.  You will need to create a new folder called “Training\_YourNameHere” in methods so you can always have copies of what you created in the class. &#x20;
2. Switch to the Deck Layout View in the Hamilton Method Editor by selecting the “Test Tube” icon in the top, middle of the toolbar. &#x20;

3. If necessary, add a “New Instrument”, as shown below, by selecting the “Devices” tab, the “Add new instrument” radio button.  Select the ML\_STAR from the drop down, and then click “Add”.   &#x20;

4. In the _Deck Layout_ window, select the _Labware_ tab to begin building the deck layout.

5. Assure that the _Generate default deck sequences_ checkbox is checked and _Stamp Tool_ is set to _1000uL Channels._

6. Add the following Labware to your deck: \
   \
   \*Note – It is very useful to use the “Search Labware” field.  You can type a partial name and the labware of interest is likely to come up!

* 1x Slide Waste - Core 96 Slide Waste
* 1x Tip Carrier - Tip\_Car\_480BC\_ST preloaded with 300µL Standard Volume tips.&#x20;
* 1x Empty Tip Carrier - TIP\_CAR\_480BC
  * Add to carrier: 3x racks of 1000µl High Volume tips to positions 1-3 and 2x racks of 10µL Low Volume tips to positions 4-5. &#x20;
* 4x Sample tube carriers - SMP\_CAR\_24\_15x75\_A00
* 1x Reagent carrier with 3 reagent tubs - RGT\_CAR\_3R\_A01
  * Note the “A01” indicates the revision. &#x20;
* 1x Plate Carrier - PLT\_CAR\_L5MD\_A00
  * Add to carrier: 4x Nunc plates - NUN\_96\_FL Lb (low border) onto positions 1-4 and a 384-well plate - Nun\_384\_Sq.rck onto position 5.
* 1x Deep-Well Plate Carrier - PLT\_CAR\_L5AC\_A00 &#x20;
  *   Add to carrier: 1x Hamilton Reagent plate - Ham\_DW\_Rgt\_96\_L in whatever position you’d like and 1x Hamilton Reagent plate - Ham\_DW\_Rgt\_L.

      * \*Note – Notice the Rgt\_96\_L vs. Rgt\_L?  This has to do with the _number of sequence positions._ We’ll get into this later and the naming will make sense!



Once you’ve populated the deck, refer to the deck view below, and double check that everything is there.

Save the Method and Deck Layout by selecting the “Save All” button, or use the hotkey shortcut - CTRL + SHIFT + S. &#x20;

\***Note – SAVE EARLY AND OFTEN**.  Computers are not perfect, and you can lose a lot of hard work if the computer or software crashes and you have not saved in a while!



9. Keep this deck layout for all future challenges and methods for the training class.  For future challenges, you can open the previous method (in this case Basic\_Deck) “Save As” and give it the new method name.  That way, you have a record of your progress through the challenges!
