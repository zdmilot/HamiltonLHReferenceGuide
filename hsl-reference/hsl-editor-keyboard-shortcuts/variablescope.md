## Variable Scope

&#x20;

HSL has two main scopes: global and local. If a variable is declared outside of any function definition, it is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout the program. If a variable is declared inside of a function definition, it is a local variable. It is created and destroyed every time the function is executed; it cannot be accessed by anything outside the function.

A local variable can have the same name as a global variable, but it is entirely distinct and separate. Consequently, changing the value of one variable has no effect on the other. Inside the function in which the local variable is declared, only the local version has meaning.
