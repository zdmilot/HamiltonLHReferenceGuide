# Logical Not

## Description

Performs logical negation on an expression.

## Syntax

result = ! expression

The ! operator syntax has these parts:

| Part       | Description                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| result     | An object of type variable.        |
| expression | Any numeric or Boolean expression. |

## Remarks

The following table illustrates how result is determined.

| If expression is | Then result is |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| nonzero          | zero           |
| zero             | nonzero        |

For the ! operator, if expression is nonzero, result is zero. If expression is zero, result is 1.

If the numeric expression does not evaluate to a number or Boolean expression, a run-time error is generated by the ! operator.
