# Logical OR

## Description

Performs a logical disjunction on two expressions.

## Syntax

result = expression1 || expression2

The || operator syntax has these parts:

| Part        | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| result      | An object of type variable. |
| expression1 | Any numeric expression.     |
| expression2 | Any numeric expression.     |

## Remarks

If either or both expressions evaluate to True, result is True. The following table illustrates how result is determined:

| If expression1 is | And expression2 is | The result is |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| True              | True               | True          |
| True              | False              | True          |
| False             | True               | True          |
| False             | False              | False         |

&#x20;

If either of the expressions does not evaluate to a number, a run-time error is generated by the || operator.
