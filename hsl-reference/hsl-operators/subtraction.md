# Subtraction

## Description

Used to find the difference between two numbers or to indicate the negative value of a numeric expression.

## Syntax 1

result = expression1 - expression2

## Syntax 2

\- expression

The - operator syntax has these parts:

| Part        | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| result      | An object of type variable. |
| expression  | Any numeric expression.     |
| expression1 | Any numeric expression.     |
| expression2 | Any numeric expression.     |

## Remarks

In Syntax 1, the - operator is the arithmetic subtraction operator used to find the difference between two numbers. In Syntax 2, the - operator is used as the unary negation operator to indicate the negative value of an expression.

If either of the expressions does not evaluate to a number, a run-time error is generated by the - operator.
