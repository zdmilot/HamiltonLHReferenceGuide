# Bitwise OR

## Description

Performs a bitwise OR on two expressions.

## Syntax

result = expression1 | expression2

The | operator syntax has these parts:

| Part        | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| result      | An object of type variable. |
| expression1 | Any numeric expression.     |
| expression2 | Any numeric expression.     |

## Remarks

The | operator looks at the binary representation of the values of two expressions and does a bit-wise OR operation on them. The result of this operation behaves as follows:

0101 (expression1)

1100 (expression2)

\----

1101 (result)

Any time either of the expressions has a 1 in a digit, the result will have a 1 in that digit. Otherwise, the result will have a 0 in that digit.

If either of the expressions does not evaluate to a number, a run-time error is generated by the | operator.
