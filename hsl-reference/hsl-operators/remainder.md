# Remainder

## Description

Divides two numbers and returns the remainder.

## Syntax

result = expression1 % expression2

The % operator syntax has these parts:

| Part        | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| result      | An object of type variable. |
| expression1 | Any numeric expression.     |
| expression2 | Any numeric expression.     |

## Remarks

The modulus, or remainder, operator divides expression1 by expression2 (not rounding floating-point numbers to integers) and returns only the remainder as result. For example, in the following expression, A (which is result) equals 5.6.

A = 19 % 6.7

If either of the numeric expressions calculates to a floating-point number the operator % calculates the floating-point remainder f of x / y such that x = i \* y + f, where i is an integer, f has the same sign as x, and the absolute value of f is less than the absolute value of y.

If either of the expressions does not evaluate to a number, a run-time error is generated by the % operator.
