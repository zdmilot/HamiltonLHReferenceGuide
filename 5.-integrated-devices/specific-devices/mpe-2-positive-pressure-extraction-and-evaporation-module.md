Use of the \[MPE]² The \[MPE]² is designed to automate applications like Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE). The device’s dual elevator system transports a filter plate to an air manifold, applies pressure to the plate via an air pump, and forces liquid through the filter plate into a collection plate or liquid waste. All processes, including conditioning, washing, adding samples, and collecting eluate are completely automated without the need for user interaction.&#x20;

In addition to the SPE functionality, the \[MPE]² can function as an evaporator or plate dryer through the use of an optional drying manifold and inline air heater module. The \[MPE]² can be integrated into NIMBUS, STAR, and Microlab VANTAGE platforms or used as a benchtop device. When used without an instrument, the \[MPE]² is programmed using VENUS and an HSL driver.
