## Safety <a href="#bookmark8" id="bookmark8"></a>

### Safe use of the HiG3 Centrifuge <a href="#bookmark9" id="bookmark9"></a>

This chapter covers the safety icons and warnings used throughout the manual. Consider each warning and caution within the context of the page it appears on.

#### Integration warnings <a href="#bookmark10" id="bookmark10"></a>

Do not attempt to operate the HIG3 Centrifuge without personnel access safeguards. The HiG3 Centrifuge is designed to operate only as an element within an automated system. Such systems shut down when the system is approached too closely.
