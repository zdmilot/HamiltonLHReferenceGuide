# Workflow Statement Types

To help understand how to read and write workflows, consider each workflow statement to be one of the following statement types.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (6).png>) **Initialization Statements** - Initialization statements augment automation commands when you set up the workflow execution environment. See Initialization Statements on page 27.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (5).png>) **Automation Command Statements** - Automation command statements are available as part of the SoftMax Pro Software Automation API. See Automation Command Statements on page 28.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (7).png>) **Worksheet Formatting Statements** - Worksheet formatting statements retrieve the data from the SoftMax Pro Software, define the format of the data to write to the worksheet, and write it to the worksheet. See Worksheet Formatting Statements on page 28.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (5).png>) **Workflow Control Statements** - Workflow control statements allow the workflow to repeat a section of statements or pause until a condition is satisfied. See Workflow Flow Control Statements on page 41.
