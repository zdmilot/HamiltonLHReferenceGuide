# Editing Excel Workflows

When you edit workflows, keep in mind how workflow statements are interpreted when the workflow is run.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (4) (1) (1).png>) The first blank column in the statement row indicates the end of the statement and then the next statement in the following row executes.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (5) (1) (1).png>) The first blank row indicates the end of the workflow.

**Moving the Execute Button**

When you create a long workflow, you can move the Execute button.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (2).jpeg>)

Right-click the button and drag it to the new location.
