# Chapter 3: SoftMax Pro Excel Workflows

The SoftMax Pro Excel workflows augment the handling of Plate Format Data by the SoftMax Pro Software with Excel-based handling of List Format Data. SoftMax Pro Excel workflows allow you to run discontinuous kinetic reads, multiplexed reads, kinetic well scan reads, and temperature-triggered reads.

The SoftMax Pro Automation SDK is the underlying mechanism that the SoftMax Pro Excel workflows use to access the SoftMax Pro Software functionality. The SoftMax Pro Excel workflow feature is a standard Excel Add-In that you can use through the application of the Excel Charting & Trend Line features. The Add-In has been tested with Windows 10 to run automated workflows.

The Excel Add-In is compatible with the following versions of Microsoft Excel: ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (1).png>) Microsoft Excel 2007 (version 12)

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (2).png>) Microsoft Excel 2010 (version 14)

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (2).png>) Microsoft Excel 2013 (version 15)

When you install the Add-In and enable macros, you can run or edit the provided workflows or create your own. You can write custom formulas if you have knowledge of Excel Visual Basic. See Custom Excel Formulas on page 45.

You can also use the following Microsoft Add-Ins. ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (1).png>) Analysis ToolPak
