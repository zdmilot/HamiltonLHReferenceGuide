# \[MPE]² Troubleshooting

This section describes possible solutions for errors that can occur during routine use of the \[MPE]². If the solutions presented in this section do not resolve the errors, contact service.

## Insufficient Vacuum

If the vacuum pressure is insufficient, there could be a bad connection somewhere in the waste tubing.

### Solution

Check all connections in the waste tubing. Make sure the waste bottle cap is tightly screwed on, and that all tubes are securely connected to their valves. Inspect the tubing for any punctures or holes, and replace damaged tubing as necessary.

## Excess Vacuum/Vacuum Fails to Initialize

If the vacuum encounters an error on initialization, there could be an issue with the check valve. This error can occur if the waste lines are not flushed during daily maintenance, or if especially viscous reagents are used.

| Solution 1 | Flush the waste lines. |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Solution 2 | Clean the check valve. |

### Solution 1

First, make sure the waste lines are clear.&#x20;

### Solution 2

If flushing the waste lines does not work, the check valve may need to be cleaned.

1. Remove both ends of the tubing from the check valve.
2. Using pliers and a wrench (or another pair of pliers), unscrew the two halves of the check valve. Keep the check valve vertical to keep the spring and steel ball within from falling out.![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

4.  Clean the O-Ring using isopropyl alcohol (or another appropriate cleaning agent) and replace it in the check valve. Make sure it is centered in the bore.\

6. Replace the steel ball in the check valve. Make sure it is centered on the spring.
7. Screw the two halves of the check valve together. Using a small tool, push on the steel ball to make sure it moves freely on the spring.
8. Reconnect the check valve. Make sure the chamfered end of the valve points in the direction of liquid flow.

## Issues with Plate Sealing

If plates are sticking after they are sealed or the plates do not seal properly, there may be a problem with the gasket. These problems can occur if the gasket is not cleaned thoroughly during daily maintenance, or if the gasket is damaged.

| Solution 1 | Clean the gasket.              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Solution 2 | Inspect the gasket for damage. |

### Solution 1

First, make sure the gasket is clean.

### Solution 2

IUf plates are still not sealing properly, the gasket could be damaged. Remove the gasket and inspect it for tears. If the gasket is torn or otherwise damaged, contact Hamilton for help replacing the gasket.
