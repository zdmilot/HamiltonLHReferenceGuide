# Inheco TEC Control

The TEC Control Unit (MTC or STC) controls the temperature and shaking performance (frequency, amplitude, pattern) for a range of INHECO's heating/cooling units and shakers. Examples of devices which are controlled by the TEC Control Unit: CPAC, HeatPAC, Heated Lid, Teleshake 95, Thermoshake, etc.&#x20;

The Multi TEC Control (MTC) controls up to six different devices simultaneously and independently. The Single TEC Control (STC) controls one device.&#x20;

The TEC Control Unit (MTC/STC) is primarily used to operate withina n automated liquid handling workstation and usually requires software integration for this purpose. This is not part of the INHECO scope of delivery please contact workstation manufacturer.&#x20;

The TEC Control Unit is designed specifically for use in Life Science and In Vitro Diagnostics. The TEC Control Unit is prepared for easy integration into IVD appicl ations, but the final IVD validation has to be performed by the first marketer (IVD application).&#x20;

When using the TEC Control Unit in a Biosafety Laboratory Environment, the user of the TEC Control Unit is responsible for labeling the device accordnig to the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual (ISBN 9241546506). Furthermore, the user is responsible for operating the TEC Control Unit in accordance with the biosafety level regulaitons of the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual.&#x20;

A technical skilled integrator has to install and integrate theT EC Control Unit. The TEC Control Unit and its connected devices must be used exclusively by laboratory professionals trained in laboratory techniques and having studied the instructions for use of this instrument as well as the instructions of the workstation the device is used in.
