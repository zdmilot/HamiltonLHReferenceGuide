Discovery Stalled by Manual Inventory Management

Curb the Clipboard and Automate Your Inventory

When you’re at the bench, research and discovery are at the forefront. You want to have the samples you need, when you need them, but anyone who has worked in a laboratory setting can tell you that this is no small task. Locating assets takes time in a manual inventory management environment and riffling through stacks of paper and notebooks is commonplace. Add to that a space where hazardous chemicals line walls and cabinets, and lab managers are left to establish a tracking program for chemical ordering, chemical inventory management, and disposal of these harmful chemicals. When does discovery take place?

[**Take back the bench**](https://www.tersosolutions.com/case-studies/laboratory-automation-through-smart-inventory-management/) and get full visibility of all your assets, including hazardous chemicals.

Inventory Management- the catalyst for the scientific process

How RAIN RFID Can Help

You need a system you can trust. Something that can store and track lab inventory that needs to be kept at a certain temperatures. This is a RAIN RFID inventory management system. With [RFID devices](https://www.tersosolutions.com/search-all-devices/) and our inventory management software, you can easily locate assets, keep items securely stored, and create a safe space where all hazardous chemicals are accounted for.

RAIN RFID allows you to:

* Reduce lost samples
* Easily track sample locations
* Maintain proper temperature for cold storage items
* Save time and resources
* Maintain compliance

Create a Smart Room

The Ideal Solution for Chemical Tracking

Knowing what you have, when you have it is important, but it can be life or death when it comes to tracking hazardous chemicals. These chemicals are unavoidable in a laboratory setting, but it doesn’t mean they’re unmanageable. Sometimes the amount of chemicals you have can fit in a cabinet, but many times they require more space. For situations like these, Terso has a fully modular solution. Pick and choose between read point devices to maximize your space and your inventory.
