### Improved productivity with effective sample management

Thermo Scientific™ TCAutomation™ Cold Storage is a refrigerated storage system from which samples can be automatically retrieved back to the track for re-testing or discharged according to the programmable timing.

Four different storage profiles, programmable according to the test and automatic discharge function, can be selected.

## Highly flexible system with automated archiving functionality

### **Cold Storage System**

* Storage capacity up to 14 800 tubes
* Temperature range from 4 to 8 °C
* Loading throughput up to 700 tubes/ hour
* Equipped with 68-position multitube racks
* Interactive user interface
* Effective and flexible disposing function with two waste bins
* Operator can retrieve up to eight tubes at a time in case manual handling is needed.
* Easy access to the storage area ensures maintenance convenience.
* One TCAutomation system can support multiple Cold Storage systems allowing scalable storage capacity according to the changing needs.

### Labor-intensive tasks can be automated in different combinations

| **Automated processes:** |
| ------------------------ |
| Sample log-in            |
| Centrifugation           |
| Decapping                |
| Aliquoting               |
| Labelling                |
| Sorting                  |
| Recapping                |
| Storage                  |
| Retrieval                |

The highly flexible TCAutomation laboratory automation solutions improve safety and efficiency in many kinds of clinical laboratories. Depending on the floor plan and

efficiency requirements, the TCAutomation systems can be expanded step by step.

Samples are transported within the TCAutomation system in a multitube carrier, which includes an embedded microchip. This chip, based on RFID technology, enables faster and more reliable sample identification as well as excellent real-time sample tracking possibilities.

Analytical integration can be extended by adding analyzer interfaces from various manufactures. Combining two or more analyzers into one system offers increased analyzer throughput, higher efficiency and longer walk-away time.
