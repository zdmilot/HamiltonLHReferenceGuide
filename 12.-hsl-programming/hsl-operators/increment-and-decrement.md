# Increment and Decrement

## Description

Used to increment or decrement an object of type variable by one.

## Syntax

result = identifier ++

result = identifier --

result = ++ identifier

result = -- identifier

identifier ++

identifier --

\++ identifier

\-- identifier

The ++ and -- operator syntax has these parts:

| Part       | Description                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| result     | An object of type variable  |
| identifier | An object of type variable. |

## Remarks

The increment and decrement operators are used as a shortcut to modify the value stored in an object of the type variable. The value of an expression containing one of these operators is the value before the increment/decrement if the operand precedes the operator (postfix expression) and the value after the increment/decrement if the operand succeeds the operator (prefix expression). The result is not an l-value.

```clike
variable i, j, m, n;
m = n = 2;
i = ++n;
j = m++;
```

i is assigned the value 3, as the increment occurs before the expression is evaluated and j is assigned the value 2, as the increment occurs after the expression is evaluated.

If the object of type variable does not have an integer value, a run-time error is generated by the ++ or -- operator.
