# Addition

## Description

Used to sum two numbers.

## Syntax

result = expression1 + expression2

The + operator syntax has these parts:

| Part        | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| result      | An object of type variable. |
| expression1 | Any expression.             |
| expression2 | Any expression.             |

## Remarks

Either both of the expressions must evaluate to a number, or both of the expressions must evaluate to a string. Otherwise, a run-time error is generated by the comparison operator.
