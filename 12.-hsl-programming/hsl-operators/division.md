# Division

## Description

Used to divide two numbers and to return a numeric result.

## Syntax

result = expression1 / expression2

The / operator syntax has these parts:

| Part        | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| result      | An object of type variable. |
| expression1 | Any numeric expression.     |
| expression2 | Any numeric expression.     |

## Remarks

If either of the expressions does not evaluate to a number, a run-time error is generated by the / operator.
