# Logical AND

## Description

Performs a logical conjunction on two expressions.

## Syntax

result = expression1 && expression2

The && operator syntax has these parts:

| Part        | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| result      | An object of type variable. |
| expression1 | Any numeric expression.     |
| expression2 | Any numeric expression.     |

## Remarks

If, and only if, both expressions evaluate to True, result is True. If either expression evaluates to False, result is False.

If either of the expressions does not evaluate to a number, a run-time error is generated by the && operator.
