# Canceled: Command cancelled

Error recovery dialogs present recovery options for each command. If the operator selects the Cancel button in the error dialog, open the cover during a run or unload a carrier manually, the command ends and the user defined error handling in the method will be used. The run is aborted if no error handling is defined.
