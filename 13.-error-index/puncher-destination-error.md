# Puncher destination error

If you want make a punch into a well, be sure the plate (well) is correct positioned under the puncher.

It is necessary that the sequence position is on the same position between the positioning of the plate and punch action. otherwise the sample tracking is track a wrong well to the database.

&#x20;

If the puncher is move up or down to the plate surface be sure the same plate is used as stay under the puncher.
