# Dialog to define error handling

## Error Handling dialog

This dialog lists the errors that can occur during an instrument step and allows use of predefined default error handling or to configure a custom error recovery.

&#x20;

**Error List:**

This table lists all errors of the step.

&#x20;

**Error**

The name of the error.

&#x20;

**ðŸžŽ Use default**

If checked the predefined default error handling will be used. If unchecked a custom error recovery can be configured.

&#x20;

**Description**

Shows a short description of the error.

&#x20;

**Error Recovery Settings:**

The error recovery settings show the predefined error handling if _Use default_ is checked; if not checked it allows to configure custom error recovery.

&#x20;

**Timeout**

**Infinite**

If checked, an infinite timeout is used.\
The step error recovery dialog is not closed automatically, user input is required in any case.

&#x20;

**Custom**

Time in seconds to wait for user input before the automatic error handling will be started.\
If timeout is set to 0 (zero) the error recovery will be started immediately (no step error dialog is shown).\
Only enabled if _Infinite Timeout_ is not checked.

&#x20;

**Error Recovery List**

The table shows the error recovery options for the currently selected error in the _Error List_.

&#x20;

**Recovery**

The name of the recovery option.

&#x20;

**ðŸžŽ 1st Recovery**\
Indicates which error recovery will be executed after timeout has elapsed. Exactly one recovery must be checked as first recovery.\
Only enabled if _Infinite Timeout_ is not checked.

&#x20;

**ðŸžŽ 2nd Recovery**\
After _First Recovery_ is finished and the same error occurs again, the second recovery will be started after the timeout has elapsed.\
If a second recovery is defined, the count of _Repetitions for the first recovery_ must be set at least to 1 (if set to 0, the system will implicit set the number of _Repetitions_ to 1).\
Only enabled if _Infinite Timeout_ is not checked.

&#x20;

**ðŸžŽ Visible**\
If checked, the corresponding button is enabled within step error dialog.

&#x20;

&#x20;

**Description**

&#x20;

**Repetitions for the 1st Recovery**\
Defines the number of repetitions of _First Recovery_ before the _Second Recovery_ will be started.\
Only enabled if _Infinite Timeout_ is not checked.

&#x20;

Note:\
If Repetitions is set to 0 (zero) and no Second Recovery is defined, the First Recovery will be used as many times as necessary. This may lead - depending of set recovery and persistence of error - to an endless loop. It is recommended to use a proper timeout to enable user interaction.

&#x20;

**ðŸžŽ Show infinite dialog**

If _Show infinite dialog_ is set as second recovery, the step error dialog is visible with infinite timeout and user interaction becomes necessary.\
Only enabled if _Infinite Timeout_ is not checked.
