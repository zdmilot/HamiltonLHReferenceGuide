# Probes do not fit in labware : Not enough probes

There are not enough positions remaining in the target sequence for the selected probes.

&#x20;

When a specific subset of tips is configured for use in a command, the instrument component attempts to use all of the selected tips. If the number of selected tips is greater than the number of positions remaining in the target sequence, this error is generated. This error will not occur if all tips are specified for use in a command (i.e. 'optimized channel' set to 'on'). In this case, the instrument uses the remaining number of tips for the command.
