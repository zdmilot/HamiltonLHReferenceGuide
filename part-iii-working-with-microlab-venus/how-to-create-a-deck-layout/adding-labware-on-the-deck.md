# Adding Labware on the Deck

## Introduction

Practically, a deck can be configured freely. Here, the term “Labware” refers to the carriers (available from Hamilton), reagent troughs, microplates, sample tubes (from various manufacturers) and tip racks.

The general steps are as follows:

1. Add a carrier to the deck
2. Add the plate to the carrier

It is possible to mix plates on a carrier; like adding Microplates to a Deep Well Plate Carrier. However, please keep in mind that the laser line of the Autoload reads at a specific height and will not be able to read barcodes on the Microplates if they are located on a Deep Well Plate carrier.

### Adding a Carrier by the Search Labware Function

To add labware to the deck layout, make sure the “Labware” Tab is selected, highlighted on the picture below.

The “Search Labware” Function is a powerful tool that simplifies the deck layout creation. Instead of browsing through the tree structure, a simple query in the “Search Labware” Field helps in finding the desired labware quickly.

To add a plate carrier to the deck layout, use the “Search Labware” Field found on top of the labware window, highlighted on the image below.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (31) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To find a labware, enter search criteria in the text field. The box right below the text field will display all the matching results based on the specified search string. Please note that not only the labware name, but also its description in plain text is scanned to generate the matching results.

Select the desired carrier and “Drag and Drop” the item onto the deck layout.

### Adding a Carrier through Tree Selection

Another way to find the labware for the deck is to use the tree structure of the labware. Click the “Labware” Tab in the “Deck Layout” Window.

In the tree view located on the left side of the window, click \[Plate carriers] (ML STAR Carriers). The list view in the center shows the available plate carriers.

In the list view located on the center of the window, click the carrier that should be placed on the deck. An image of the carrier with its corresponding description will be shown on the right most side of the window. Click on the image of the carrier and “Drag and Drop” it to the appropriate location on the deck. All these are shown in the picture below.

The place where the carrier will be dropped is indicated by a frame during this operation.

The carrier, once dropped, is added onto the deck layout and is projected on the left side of the deck as shown below.

VENUS M allows for optimal use of deck space, allowing to place carriers in the minus (left of Track 1 (-3 to +3)) area.

### Adding a Plate to the Carrier

\


The next step is to add a plate to the carrier. The corresponding labware (plates, tip racks, etc.) is sorted by manufacturer and stored within the labware directory. Standard plates from almost every major manufacturer (Nunc, Falcon, Greiner, etc.) are available. These names (or brands) can also be entered directly in the “Search Labware” Field.

Microplates, tip racks, etc. are labware items that are generally called “Racks” and have “.rck” file name extensions.

To add a plate to the carrier, open the “Plates” Group from the tree list on the top left of the deck layout window. The different groups of plates are displayed in the list.

In the “Plate” List, click to select the appropriate plate group. In the list view found on the center of the window, the plates belonging to the group are shown.

Click the desired plate type from the list. An image of the plate with its corresponding description will be presented on the right most side of the window. Click the plate and “Drag and Drop” it onto the location of the appropriate plate carrier. These are shown in the image below.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (38) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The spot on the carrier where the plate will be dropped is indicated by a green frame during this action. The plate, once dropped, is added to the deck layout and is projected on the carrier found on the lower left side of the deck, as shown below.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (39) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When hovered, the tool tip info shows the name of the carrier and its position.

Plates (or labware) on a carrier may be moved between sites by simply “Dragging and Dropping”.



### Adding a Plate directly onto the Deck

Labware, as seen in the example below, can also be placed directly onto the instrument deck without using a carrier.

Drag and drop the item from the image view onto the deck (see the image below). The item is placed wherever the left mouse button is released.

To define the position of the item according to its coordinates, select the item and right-click to enter the Context Menu. Select \[Adjust Location…] to trigger the settings dialog.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (40) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A dialog box which allows settings specification will appear, as presented below.

Use the "Absolute Rotation" Settings to rotate the labware item freely “Other” or in increments of 90° clockwise.

Enter the desired position coordinates in the entry fields of “Location” for the reference point of the selected labware. The reference point is marked red (usually A1 for plates). Note that there is a 100 mm offset from the origin to the deck. Meaning, a plate placed directly on the deck’s surface will have a Z-coordinate of 100 mm.

Click \[OK] to close the dialog.

The item as seen below is moved to the specified position.
