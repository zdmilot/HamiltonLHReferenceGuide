# High-Throughput Screening (HTS)

High-throughput screening (hts) combines robotic automation, liquid handling, and signal detection to quickly identify drug discovery candidates. biomek workstations enhance hts with flexible, precise, and scalable solutions for various assays. automation in hts is crucial for generating high-quality data efficiently, reducing project timelines and costs.

HTS is a robust approach that has become a standard method for identifying interesting candidates for drug discovery, biomarker research and other applications. HTS brings together robotic automation, liquid handling, and signal detection in a combinational approach to produce rich data sets in a short period of time. Automation is a critical component of HTS, as speed, throughput, and the production of high-quality data are important.

HTS is the process of screening large numbers of biological modulators against selected targets. HTS systems are used to screen different types of libraries such as chemical, genomics, protein, and peptide libraries. Full-scale HTS libraries can extend into many thousands of modulators, and HTS systems may screen 10,000-100,000+ per day or week.

Screening a large number of biological modulators across a panel of targets generates a number of active hits, which are then validated through secondary screening prior to advancement for more in-depth study. Scaling up of assay liquid volumes is an important consideration in many HTS applications, as confirmational secondary screening is often performed in larger-volume assays or through secondary screens with a different volume requirement.
