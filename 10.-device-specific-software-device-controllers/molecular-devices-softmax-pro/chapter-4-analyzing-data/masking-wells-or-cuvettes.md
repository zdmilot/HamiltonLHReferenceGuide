# Masking Wells or Cuvettes

Use the Mask feature to hide data so that the data is not used for calculations and is not reported. You mask wells to suppress outliers from data reduction calculations. You can use masking as a “what if?” tool. For example, if you include a group blank in a template and want to see the data both with and without the blank, mask the group blanks to suppress the blanking function and unmask the group blanks to use the blanking function.

To mask wells and cuvettes:

1. In a Plate section or a Cuvette Set section, select the wells or cuvettes to mask. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (4).png>) Click and drag the cursor across the wells to select multiple wells in a plate. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (4).png>) Press CTRL and click to select multiple cuvettes.
2. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (3).jpeg>) in the section toolbar or on the Home tab or right-click a well or cuvette and select **Mask**.
3. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (2).jpeg>) a second time to unmask masked wells or cuvettes.

### Zooming Well and Cuvette Display

Use the Zoom Well and Zoom Well Options dialogs to magnify the well display. This feature is available when the data in a well or cuvette can be enlarged.
