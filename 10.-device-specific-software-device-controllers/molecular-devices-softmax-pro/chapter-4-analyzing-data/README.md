# Chapter 4: Analyzing Data

Each document has a minimum of one Plate section or one Cuvette Set section. Most documents have a plate template and related Group sections, Graph sections, and Note sections. Depending upon the protocol and how you want to report the data, some documents may not have all sections.

Some simple protocols, such as a read of the absorbance of proteins at 280 nm in a cuvette or in a plate with PathCheck Pathlength Measurement Technology, let you calculate concentration in the Plate section or Cuvette Set section which makes Group sections and Graph sections necessary only if you want to display the data in tables or graphically.

Many protocols consist of data acquired in a Plate section or Cuvette Set section. You define standards and unknowns in a template. The software then interpolates the unknowns froma standard curve.
