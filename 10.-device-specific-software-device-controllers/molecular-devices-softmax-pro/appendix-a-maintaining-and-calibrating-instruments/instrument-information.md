The Instrument Information dialog lists the PIC firmware version, the instrument firmware version, the instrument serial number, and the automation device number for the SpectraMax iD5, SpectraMax iD3, SpectraMax i3x, SpectraMax i3, SpectraMax Paradigm, FilterMax F3, and FilterMax F5. To update the PIC or instrument firmware, click the **Update** button. For more information about how to update firmware, contact Molecular Devices support.

To view the Instrument Information dialog, on the Operations tab in the ribbon click **Info**. The lower portion of the dialog shows instrument-specific information.
