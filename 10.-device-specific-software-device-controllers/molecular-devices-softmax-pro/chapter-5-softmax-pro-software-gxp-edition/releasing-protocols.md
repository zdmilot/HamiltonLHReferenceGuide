### GxP Statements

Use the Statements dialog to manage statements. Use statements to communicate and get sign off for a document. You use statements in conjunction with the document status to indicate who created the document, reviewed the document, ran the assay, and approved the results.

Each document can have multiple statements. Each statement can have one signature so if the document requires multiple signatures, you need to add the corresponding number of statements. Each user can sign only one statement. After a statement is signed you cannot edit the document or add new statements so you should add all the required statements before you start getting signatures.

The following user permissions pertain to statements:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (7) (1) (1) (1).png>) **Add/Modify Statements** - Grants the user permission to add or modify statements. See Adding Statements on page 269.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (8) (1).png>) **Sign Statements** - Grants the user permission to sign statements. See Signing Statements on page 271.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (6) (1).png>) **Revoke Any Signature** - Grants the user permission to revoke any signature from statements. See Revoking Signatures from Statements on page 272.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (8) (1).png>) **Revoke Own Signature** - Grants the user permission to revoke only their own signatures from statements.
