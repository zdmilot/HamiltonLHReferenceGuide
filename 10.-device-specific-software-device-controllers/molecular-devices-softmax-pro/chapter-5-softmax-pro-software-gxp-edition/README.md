# Chapter 5: SoftMax Pro Software - GxP Edition

Molecular Devices provides a fully integrated hardware and software solution for adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), and many other regulatory compliance requirements including 21 CFR Part 11. The SoftMaxÂ® Pro GxP Microplate Data Compliance Software extends the SoftMax Pro Software into regulated laboratories that work under GMP, GLP, and 21 CFR Part 11 guidelines for secure electronic records. SoftMax Pro Software - GxP edition functions similarly to the SoftMax Pro Software - Standard edition but adds a user logon requirement, electronic signature capability, and auditing features that maintain audit trails for electronic records.

The typical regulated laboratory environment has several check points to confirm the integrity of an assay. The SoftMax Pro Software - GxP edition allows users with appropriate permissions to assign a corresponding status to documents to track and restrict the document through each check point. See Document Workflow on page 257.
