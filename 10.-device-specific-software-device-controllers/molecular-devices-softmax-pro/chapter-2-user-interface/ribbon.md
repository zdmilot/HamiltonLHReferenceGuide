![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/14 (7).png>) Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/15 (6).jpeg>) **Protocol Manager** to display the list of protocols in the Protocol Library. The Protocol Library contains over 160 protocols that contain instrument settings and formulas. You can customize the protocols in the Protocol Library to facilitate the data analysis and report creation.

Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/16 (5).jpeg>) **Acquisition Settings** to display the Settings dialog where you define instrument settings for the read. See Acquisition Settings on page 109.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/17 (9).png>) Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/18 (6).jpeg>) **ABS**, ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/19 (4).jpeg>) **FL**, and ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/20 (4).jpeg>) **LUM** to do a quick start absorbance, fluorescence, or luminescence read using default settings. (Available for SpectraMax iD3 and SpectraMax iD5.)

**Controls and Status** - Icons to start and stop a read.

&#x20;Click  **Read** to read the Plate section or Cuvette Set section you select in the Navigation Tree.

**Note:** Use the Auto Read button on the Operations tab to read from multiple Plate sections or Cuvette Set sections. As information is read, the Workspace display the data.



Click  **Stop** to stop the read. The read stops immediately. If you click Stop while the plate is being read for a kinetic time point, the software completes the data collection for that time point before the read stops.

**Note:** If you stop a Kinetic read before it completes, you cannot restart the read or append data to the read. You must either let the read finish or click  **Interrupt** to pause the read.



&#x20;For Kinetic reads, click  **Interrupt** to pause the read, and then click  **Append** to continue the Kinetic read from where it left off. When you interrupt a read, the instrument finishes the read for all the wells you select in the plate and then waits for your input before continuing. This type of discontinuous kinetic read can help with acquisition development.

&#x20;After a Kinetic read ends successfully, click  **Append** to read the same Plate section again and append the data to the data that already exists in the Plate section.

When you select a section in the Navigation Tree, the Home tab displays section-specific icons:

&#x20;**Notes Controls** and **Formatting Tools** display when you select a Note section. See Note Sections on page 70.

&#x20;**Plate Tools** and **Template Tools** display when you select a Plate section. See Plate Sections on page 76.
