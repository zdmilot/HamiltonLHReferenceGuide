# Group Section Export Formats

The following is the format of Group sections that you export to a .txt or .xls file. For a copy of the SoftMax Pro .xml schema, contact Molecular Devices.

The header line contains the type of section, such as Group, and the title of the section as defined in the document.

The data lines immediately follow the header line and contain the text and data from the exported section.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (16).png>) The data from the group table displays in a table that contains the column headings in the first row followed by the data from the table.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (18).png>)Group summaries, if present, display in the rows at the end of the section.
