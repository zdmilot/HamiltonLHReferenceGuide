# Chapter 3: Collecting Data

Data collection depends upon the settings you define for each Plate section and each Cuvette Set section in the document.

**Note:** When you do not physically connect the computer to an instrument, you can select Offline or Simulator On to create documents for later use. Document settings are specific to the instrument that you select. If you change instruments, some settings may be reset to the default protocol settings.
