# Collecting Data From Membrane Holders

You can start a read after you define the acquisition settings.

Use auto read to read multiple Plate sections in the same experiment. See Using Auto Read on page 180.

If you use the SoftMax Pro Software - GxP edition, you must have the following permissions to complete a Western Blot membrane read:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (1) (1).png>) **Read Empty Plates/Cuvettes** to start a read.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (3) (1).png>) **Create/Save Data Documents** to save the data document before the read.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (3) (1).png>) **Overwrite Plate/Cuvette Data** to do a high-resolution ROI read. See SoftMax Pro Software - GxP Edition on page 247.

For information on the data-analysis tools for Western Blot images, see Viewing Western Blot Membrane Data on page 241.

  1. Select the Home tab and click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (2) (1).png>) **Open/Close** to open the instrument drawer.
  2. Insert the prepared membrane holder matching the A1 position on the membrane holder with the A1 position in the plate drawer in landscape orientation. Make sure the membrane holder is flat against the drawer bottom.

**CAUTION!** To prevent damage to the instrument or the membrane holder, make sure that all the holder clips are securely snapped into place before you insert the membrane holder into the instrument.
