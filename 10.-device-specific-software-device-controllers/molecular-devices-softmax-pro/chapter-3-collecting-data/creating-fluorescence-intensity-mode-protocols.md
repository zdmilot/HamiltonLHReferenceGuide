### Fluorescence Intensity Mode Overview

Fluorescence occurs when absorbed light is re-radiated at a longer wavelength. In the Fluorescence Intensity (FL) read mode, the instrument measures the intensity of the re- radiated light and expresses the result in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU).

The governing equation for fluorescence is:

Fluorescence = extinction coefficient × concentration × quantum yield × excitation intensity × pathlength × emission collection efficiency

Fluorescent materials absorb light energy of a characteristic wavelength (excitation), undergo an electronic state change, and instantaneously emit light of a longer wavelength (emission). Most common fluorescent materials have well-characterized excitation and emission spectra. The following figure shows an example of excitation and emission spectra for a fluorophore. The excitation and emission bands are each fairly broad, with half-bandwidths of approximately 40 nm, and the difference between the wavelengths of the excitation and emission maxima (the Stokes shift) is generally fairly small, about 30 nm. There is considerable overlap between the excitation and emission spectra (gray area) when a small Stokes shift is present.

**Tip:** If the Stokes shift is small, choose an excitation wavelength that is as far away from the emission maximum as possible while still being capable of stimulating the fluorophore so that less of the excited light overlaps the emission spectrum, permitting better selection and quantitation of the emitted light.

Because the intensity of the excitation light is usually many tens of thousands of times greater than that of the emitted light, some type of spectral separation is necessary to reduce the interference of the excitation light with detection of the emitted light.

The SpectraMax readers incorporate many features designed to restrict interference from reflected excitation light. These features include a set of long-pass emission cutoff filters that can be set automatically by the instrument or manually by the user.

Wavelength (nm)

The previous figure shows that the best results are often obtained when the excitation and emission wavelengths used for reads are not the same as the peak wavelengths or maxima of the excitation and emission spectra of the fluorophore. When the wavelengths for excitation and emission are separated, a smaller quantity of excitation light passes through to the emission monochromator (gray area) and on to the PMT, resulting in a purer emission signal and more accurate data.

The SpectraMax readers permit scanning of both excitation and emission wavelengths, using separate tunable monochromators. One benefit of scanning emission spectra is that you can determine more accurately whether the emission is, in fact, the expected fluorophore, or multiple fluorophores, and not one generated by a variety of background sources or by contaminants. One more benefit is that you can find excitation and emission wavelengths that prevent interference when interfering fluorescent species are present.

For this reason, it is desirable to scan emission for both an intermediate concentration of labeled sample, as well as the background of unlabeled sample. The optimal setting is where the ratio of the sample emission to background emission is at the maximum.

### Optimizing Fluorescence Intensity Assays

The optimal instrument settings for detection of a particular fluorophore depend on a number of different factors. Settings you can adjust for assay optimization include the excitation and emission wavelengths, emission cutoff filter, reads per well, the PMT voltage, and the temperature of the read chamber.

Another important factor that is independent of the instrument but can affect assay optimization is the Stokes shift, which is the difference between the wavelengths of the excitation and emission maxima. When the Stokes shift is very small, optimizing the excitation and emission wavelengths and correct cutoff filter choices are very important.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/7 (5) (1) (1).png>) Excitation and Emission Wavelengths

The excitation and emission wavelengths can be set in 1 nm increments between 250 nm and 850 nm. The available wavelengths are dependent on the instrument. For more information about the available wavelengths, see the documentation for the instrument you are using.

A procedure to optimize excitation and emission wavelengths for a given assay is outlined in Spectral Scanning on page 163.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/8 (5) (1) (1).png>) Emission Cutoff Filter

The emission cutoff filters assist in reducing background. Sources of background include stray excitation light and native fluorescence of plate materials, sample constituents, and solvents (including water). The default setting lets the instrument and the software determine which cutoff filter to use for the Endpoint and Kinetic read types. The Spectrum read type default uses no cutoff filter.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/9 (5) (1) (1).png>) Reads Per Well

The number of reads per well can vary between 1 (for a quick estimate) and 100 (for very precise measurements). The default number of reads per well varies with the read mode: for Fluorescence, the default is 6, and for Luminescence the instrument does 1 read per well.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/10 (3) (1) (1).png>) PMT Voltage

The voltage of the photomultiplier tube can be set to low (for higher concentration samples), medium, or high (for lower concentration samples) for all read modes. For the Endpoint and Spectrum read types, you can select Automatic to have the instrument automatically adjusts the PMT voltage for varying concentrations of sample in the plate.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/11 (3) (1) (1).png>) Temperature Control

The chamber of the instrument is isothermal at ambient as well as at elevated temperatures.

The temperature in the read chamber can be adjusted from 2°C (3.6°F) above ambient tothe maximum temperature for the instrument. See the instrument user guide.

**Spectral Scanning**

This procedure optimizes excitation and emission wavelengths for Fluorescence assays using spectral scanning.

For the SpectraMax iD3, SpectraMax iD5, SpectraMax i3x, and SpectraMax Paradigm with a Tunable Wavelength (TUNE) Detection Cartridge, see Spectral Optimization on page 182.

Pipette 200 µL of sample that includes the fluorophore and 200 µL of a buffer control into separate wells of the plate.

### Excitation Scan

1. Set up a Plate section for the Fluorescence read mode, Spectrum read type, Em Fixed/Ex Scan, with no cutoff filter (default), and medium PMT.
2. Set the emission wavelength based on the tentative value from the literature (or from a customary filter set used to measure the fluorophore). If the emission wavelength is not known, select a tentative emission wavelength about 50 nanometers greater than the absorbance maximum of the fluorophore. If necessary, the absorbance maximum can be determined by performing an optical density spectral scan first.
3. Set the excitation scan to start/stop approximately 50 nm below/above the tentative excitation value from the literature (or the customary excitation filter).
4. Set the step increment to 2 nm or 3 nm. You can choose to do a preliminary scan with a 10 nm increment to determine the approximate peak location, and then repeat the scan over a narrower wavelength range with a 2 nm or 3 nm increment.
5. Do the scan and view the results as a plot of emission fluorescence vs. excitation wavelength. Note the excitation wavelength at the emission peak and the maximum RFU value.

If a Missing Data Points message occurs, it can be due to possible saturation reported by the software at the end of the spectral scan. Reset the PMT to Low and rescan the sample (scan the buffer blank with the PMT set to Medium or High). If the error occurs after you scan with the PMT set to Low, you may need to dilute the sample.

If the excitation scan shows no apparent peak, change the PMT setting to High and rescan the sample. If the spectral scan still shows no apparent peak, adjust the Y-scale of the zoom plot so that the plot fills the graph.

1. Select the optimal excitation wavelength.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/12 (5) (1).png>) If the excitation peak wavelength and emission wavelength are separated by more than 80 nm, use the excitation peak wavelength value.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/13 (5) (1).png>) If the excitation and emission wavelengths are less than 80 nm apart, use the shortest excitation wavelength that gives 90% maximal emission. Follow the plot to the left of the peak until the RFU value falls to approximately 90% of the maximum, and then drop a line from the 90% point on the plot to the x-axis as shown in the following figure.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/14 (2).jpeg>)

**Plot of RFU and Wavelength**

### Emission Scan #1

1. Set up a second Plate section for the Fluorescence read mode, Spectrum read type, Ex Fixed/Em Scan, with no cutoff filter (default), and Medium PMT.
2. Set the excitation wavelength to the value you determine in the Excitation Scan section above.
3. Set the emission scan to start/stop approximately 50 nm below or above the tentative emission value from the literature (or existing filter pair).

**Note:** If the Stokes shift is less than 50 nm, then start the emission scan above the excitation wavelength.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/15 (2) (1) (1).png>)

1. Set the step increment to 2 nm to 3 nm (or do a preliminary scan with a 10 nm increment to determine the approximate peak location and then repeat the scan over a narrower wavelength range using a 2 nm to 3 nm increment.)
2. Do the scan and view the results as a plot of fluorescence vs. emission wavelength.

### Choose the Emission Filter

Select an emission cutoff filter that blocks as much of the residual excitation light as possible without unduly reducing the fluorescence signal. The cutoff wavelength choices are 325, 420, 435, 475, 495, 515, 530, 550, 570, 590, 610, 630, 665, or 695 nm. The cutoff value should be near the maximum emission wavelength (preferably between the excitation wavelength and the maximal emission wavelength) but a minimum of 10 nm less than the emission wavelength. If you have questions, contact Molecular Devices Technical Support and speak to an application scientist.

### Emission Scan #2

*
  1. Set up a third Plate section for an emission scan as specified in Emission Scan #1, except select the Manual Cutoff Filter and set the wavelength to the value you determine in the Choose the Emission Filter section above.
  2. Do the scan and view the results as a plot of fluorescence vs. emission wavelength. Note the wavelength that gives the maximum emission (the optimal emission wavelength).
  3. Compare the spectra of the sample that contains the fluorophore to the spectra of the buffer blank to get an estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio. If there is significant background interference, repeat the Choose the Emission Filter steps and the steps in this section with a different choice of cutoff filter.

### Results

The optimal excitation and emission wavelengths are those you determine in the Excitation Scan section and the Emission Scan #2 section.

### Comments

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/16 (4) (1) (1).png>) For the Fluorescence read mode with the Endpoint or Kinetic read type, the **AutoCutoff** feature generally selects the same cutoff filter wavelength as the previously described optimization method. However, you can specify the cutoff filters manually.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/17 (5) (1).png>) For emission wavelengths less than 325 nanometers, experimental iteration is usually the best method to determine the optimal emission and excitation wavelengths. Start the previously described optimization procedure. Try emission and excitation wavelength combinations with the 325 cutoff or with no cutoff filter. For excitation wavelengths greater than 660 nanometers, try emission and excitation wavelength combinations with the 695 cutoff or with no cutoff filter.

The following table lists default settings for the emission cutoff filters.
