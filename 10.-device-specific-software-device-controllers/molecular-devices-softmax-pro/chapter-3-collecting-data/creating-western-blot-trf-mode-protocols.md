# Creating Western Blot TRF Mode Protocols



To create a Western Blot TRF Mode protocol:

1. Start the software. See Starting the Software on page 7.
2. Select the SpectraMax Paradigm or SpectraMax i3x instrument. See Selecting an Instrument on page 58.
3. In the Navigation tree, select a Plate section.
4. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (6) (1).jpeg>) in the section toolbar, the Settings Information area, or on the Home tab to display the Settings dialog.
5. Select the **SCANLATER WB** cartridge for the ScanLater Western Blot (WB) Detection Cartridge. (Skip this step for the SpectraMax iD5.)
6. Select the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (5) (1).jpeg>) **TRF** read mode.
7. Select the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (1) (1) (1) (1).jpeg>) **Membrane** read type.
8. Define the settings. For more information about the settings, see the SoftMax Pro Application Help.
9. After you define the instrument settings, click **OK** to close the Settings dialog.
10. Save the settings to a protocol. See Saving Protocols and Data Documents on page 22.

### Western Blot TRF Mode Overview

Protein detection is an important task for pharmaceutical and clinical research, and Western Blots (WB), or protein immunoblots, are one of the most common methods employed for this purpose. Various techniques are used to detect proteins on Western Blot membranes including fluorescence, silver staining, and chemiluminescence. However, each technique has its limitations, and there is a continuous need to improve quantitation, accuracy, and dynamic range of Western Blots.

The Molecular Devices ScanLater™ Western Blot Assay Kit is a novel system for protein analysis that can be used with the SpectraMax Paradigm, SpectraMax i3x, and SpectraMax iD5. Membranes are incubated with Eu-chelate labeled secondary antibodies or streptavidin that bind specifically to the target protein-specific primary antibody. Europium has a long fluorescence lifetime, on the order of 1 msec, and detection is done in Time Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) mode which significantly reduces background from auto-fluorescence or other sources of short lifetime emissions. The membranes are placed into the instrument where they are scanned with the ScanLater Western Blot (WB) Detection Cartridge.

The method does not involve enzyme detection, and the Eu-chelates are resistant to photo- bleaching, so the signal remains stable for long periods of time (weeks to months). This allows you repeat the read of membranes and the potential for comparison of band intensities to known standards for more accurate quantitation. There is also no camera blooming, as can occur with chemiluminescence or fluorescence detection, so the system gives sharp bands and excellent image quality.

The TRF detection employs photon counting, so the theoretical dynamic range is >10 . In practice, however, dynamic range is limited by saturation of binding sites on high-abundant bands and non-specific binding to background membrane.

The SpectraMax Western Blot system is a simple, sensitive, and stable platform that provides excellent Western Blot capability for the SpectraMax Paradigm, SpectraMax i3x, and SpectraMax iD5 to extend the uses of these essential laboratory instruments.

**Loading the Membrane Holder**

**Note:** Handle membranes only by the edges using clean forceps. Take care to not touch the membrane with gloved or bare hands.

To scan a membrane, you must first place it in a Molecular Devices ScanLater™ membrane holder. The maximum size of a membrane that will fit in the membrane holder is 109 mm x 77 mm.

To load the membrane holder:

1\. Place the membrane on the membrane holder with one corner of the membrane aligned with the A1 corner of the membrane holder.

A1

1. Slide the holder clips to place them over the membrane as close to the edges of the membrane as possible to expose the maximum scanning area of the blot.
2. Lower the holder clips into place and then gently press the end of each holder clip to snap it into place and secure the membrane to the holder.

**CAUTION!** To prevent damage to the instrument or the membrane holder, make sure that all the holder clips are securely snapped into place before you insert the membrane holder into the instrument.

1. Load the membrane holder into the plate drawer with the A1 corner in the A1 position ofthe drawer. See the user guide for your instrument.
