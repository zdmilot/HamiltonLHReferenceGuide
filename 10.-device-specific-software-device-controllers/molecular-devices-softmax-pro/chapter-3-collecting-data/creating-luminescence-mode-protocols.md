# Creating Luminescence Mode Protocols

The SpectraMax L has a unique set of Luminescence Mode settings. For details see the SpectraMax L User Guide.

To create a Luminescence Mode protocol:

1. Start the software. See Starting the Software on page 7.
2. Select an instrument. See Selecting an Instrument on page 58.
3. In the Navigation Tree, select a Plate section or Cuvette Set section.
4. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (7).jpeg>) in the section toolbar, the Settings Information area, or on the Home tab to display the Settings dialog.
5. For the SpectraMax Paradigm, select a Luminescence cartridge. For the SpectraMax i3x, select either **Monochromator** or select a Luminescence cartridge.
6. Select the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (7).jpeg>) **LUM** read mode.
7. Select a Read Type.
8. Define the settings.

For more information about the settings, see the SoftMax Pro Application Help.

1. After you define the instrument settings, click **OK** to close the Settings dialog.
2. Create a template, if applicable. See Template Editor on page 87.
3. Set Data Reduction parameters, if applicable. See Data Reduction on page 193.
4. Set Display options, if applicable. See Data Display Options on page 204.
5. Save the settings to a protocol. See Saving Protocols and Data Documents on page 22.

### Luminescence Mode Protocol Overview

Luminescence is the emission of light by processes that derive energy from essentially non- thermal changes, the motion of subatomic particles, or the excitation of an atomic system by radiation. Luminescence detection relies on the production of light from a chemical reaction in a sample.

In luminescence read mode, no excitation is necessary as the species being measured emit light naturally. For this reason, the lamp does not flash, so no background interference occurs. A dark estimate is done over a dark reference, and multiple reads are averaged together into one read per well.

The default setting for luminescence is the “zero order” position where the grating monochromator acts as a mirror that reflects all light to the PMT detector. You can choose the wavelength where peak emission is expected to occur. Also, multiple wavelength choices let species with multiple components be differentiated and measured easily. In luminescence read mode, no emission cutoff filter is used.
