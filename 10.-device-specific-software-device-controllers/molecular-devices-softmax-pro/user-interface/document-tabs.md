# Document Tabs

Each tab between the Ribbon and the Workspace is a protocol or data document. The **Untitled1** tab displays the default protocol when you log on for the first time to help you create your first document. Depending on your View tab settings, as you use the software to define additional documents, each document appears as a tab above the Workspace to the left of the Untitled1 tab.

**Note:** For the SoftMax Pro Software - GxP edition, no document tabs display and the Workspace area is empty. Your permissions determine which actions you can perform. See SoftMax Pro Software - GxP Edition on page 247.

Select a tab to display the contents of the document in the Workspace.

**Tip:** If you miss the What's New tab from previous versions of the software, the Help tab on the Ribbon provides access to the Molecular Devices What's New web page. See Help Tab on page 56. The ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (1) (1) (1).jpeg>) Application menu provides access to the Application Options dialog where you can choose to display the What's New information every time you start the software. See Application Options on page 45.
