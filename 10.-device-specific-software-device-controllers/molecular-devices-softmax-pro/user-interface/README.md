# User Interface

Use the SoftMax Pro Software to perform state-of-the-art analysis. Use the software to control most Molecular Devices microplate reader instrument functions including the ability to define the settings to have the instrument run complete experiments and to define the formulas for result analysis.

When you start the software, the Untitled1 document tab displays in the Document Tabs area (number 4 in the following image) and the Workspace (number 7) displays the contents of the default protocol.

**Note:** For the SoftMax Pro Software - GxP edition, no document tabs display and the Workspace area is empty. Your permissions determine which actions you can perform.&#x20;

| 5        | **Workspace View Selectors:** Use the three buttons to change how you work with the information in the Workspace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6        | **Navigation Tree:** Use to manage and navigate the sections that make up the experiments in a document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 7        | **Workspace:** Use to define and manage the protocols and data documents. Each document contains one or more experiments and each experiment contains multiple sections for notes, instrument settings, results, and graphs.                                                                                                                          |
| 8        | **Acquisition Settings:** Provides access to the Settings dialog where you define the settings for the instrument to use to read a Plate section or a Cuvette Set section in an experiment.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 9        | **Read:** Use to run the experiment. The software collects and stores all raw data from the instrument. As information is read, the software uses the formulas you define to analyze the data and the Workspace display updates to the results.                                                                                                       |
| 10       | **Workspace Zoom Slider:** Use to zoom the focus of the Workspace in or out to view details of the experiment section content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
