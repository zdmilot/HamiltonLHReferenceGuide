# Workspace

The Workspace appears below the Ribbon. The Document tabs above the Workspace list the documents you have open. You open and save documents from the Quick Access toolbar and from the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (13).jpeg>) Application Menu.

In the Ribbon, use the View tab to split the Workspace to view multiple documents at the same time. See View Tab on page 52.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (12).jpeg>)

Use the three buttons below the Document tabs to change the Workspace view. Use each Workspace view to manage the open document and experiment results.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (10) (1) (1).png>) Use the **Document** view to scroll through the experiment sections.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (13) (1) (1).png>) Use the **Comparison** view to drag sections from the Navigation Tree and arrange them in the Workspace wherever you want.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (15) (1) (1).png>) Use the **Workflow** view to manage complex experiments that include repeated tasks and multitask kinetic reads.

The left side of the Workspace is the Navigation Tree that displays the experiments in the open document. Each document can contain a virtually unlimited number of experiments. Each experiment can contain a virtually unlimited number of Note, Plate, Cuvette Set, Group, and Graph sections.

The Navigation Tree for the Document view and Comparison view displays section controls and a list of the experiment sections. See Workspace Sections on page 68.

After you use the Document view or the Comparison view to define the experiments, the Workflow view contains icons that you drag into the Workspace to define an experiment workflow that can include delays and repeated cycles for more complex experiments.

Drag the slider on the bottom right to zoom the focus of the Workspace in or out.

### Workspace Views

### Document View

Use the Document view scrollable area to view the experiments and sections in the open document. The Document view displays by default. Click the **Document** button above the Navigation Tree, if needed.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (5).jpeg>)

To view a section either click the section in the Navigation Tree or use the scroll bar on the right until the section comes into view.

### Comparison View

Use the Comparison view to move the sections to position them where they are most useful. To use the Comparison view, click the **Comparison** button above the Navigation Tree.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (5).jpeg>)

Drag sections from the Navigation Tree into the Workspace. Sections can overlap. Double- click a section to add the section to the bottom of the list of sections in the Workspace.

### Workflow View

After you define the experiment in the Document view or the Comparison view, use the Workflow view to drag-and-drop tasks into the Workspace to create a timeline for a multi- task document that can involve several experiments with multiple reads. Define the experiments with all applicable sections from the Document view and then use the Workflow view to create the workflow that uses the experiments and Plate sections to run more complicated assays such as multitask kinetic reads that last hours or days. When you click the Workflow button above the Navigation Tree, the Ribbon automatically displays the Workflow tab. See Defining and Running Workflows on page 102.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/7 (6).jpeg>)

To create a workflow:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/8 (9) (1).png>) Drag tasks from the menu on the left to the timeline on the right. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/9 (9) (1).png>) To define repeated tasks, place the tasks in a Cycle task.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/10 (7) (1).png>) In the Ribbon, Use the Workflow tab to start, pause, resume, and cancel the workflow.

### Workspace Sections <a href="#bookmark1" id="bookmark1"></a>

Use the Workspace to manage documents. Each document can contain a virtually unlimited number of experiments. The Navigation Tree displays the experiments and experiment sections in the document.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/11 (6).jpeg>)

### Experiments

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/12 (2).jpeg>) Experiments are an organizational tool within the document to maintain separate data sets. Each experiment can contain a virtually unlimited number of sections. Use sections to document what the experiment is designed to accomplish, define instrument settings, define analytical formulas, and define the presentation of the data that the software collects.

### Sections in Experiments

Each experiment is made up of Note sections, Plate sections, Cuvette Set sections, Group sections, and Graph sections. You can create and edit sections at any point in the data collection process: before you collect data, to adjust how you collect data, and to manage the presentation of the data you collect. Links in the following list take you to the description of the settings for each section. The SoftMax Pro Software - GxP edition allows you to lock each section to restrict changes. See Locking and Unlocking Sections on page 253.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/13 (7) (1).png>) ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/14 (4).jpeg>) **Note** - Use Note sections to enter text and report summary information to the experiment. Note sections can contain text, Summary formulas, images such as your

company logo, and images of the other sections in the document. See Note Sections on page 70.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/15 (5) (1).png>) ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/16 (4).jpeg>) **Plate** - Use Plate sections to define plate settings and instrument settings to collect data from the instrument. Use plate settings you to define the data display and data reduction. Each Plate section can have unique instrument settings to run different types of reads within the experiment. See Plate Sections on page 76.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/17 (8) (1).png>) ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/18 (5).jpeg>) **Cuvette Set** - Use Cuvette Set sections to define instrument settings to collect data from a cuvette port. Each Cuvette Set section can have unique instrument settings to run different types of reads. See Cuvette Set Sections on page 80.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/19 (5) (1).png>) ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/20 (5) (1).png>) **Group** - Use Group sections to combine the data from wells in a plate or several cuvettes into groups. You create Group sections in the Template Editor dialog when you work with Plate sections and Cuvette Set sections. See Group Sections on page 82.

&#x20; **Graph** Use Graph sections to define the graphical presentation of the data the software collects as scatter plot graphs or bar graphs. See Graph Sections on page 85.

### Plate Sections <a href="#bookmark7" id="bookmark7"></a>

Use Plate sections to define plate related instrument settings, data reduction settings, and data display settings. When you want to read the same physical plate twice with different instrument settings you create two Plate sections in the experiment. You can create as many Plate sections as you need. Use Auto Read to read multiple plate sections. See Using Auto Read on page 180.

Plate sections contain a grid that represents the wells in the plate you select, instrument Settings Information to the right of the grid, and Reduction Settings below the grid. If colors appear in the plate grid, the Plate section contains templates. You assign each group in the template a different color and the Group section table displays the corresponding color.

After a read, Read Information displays below the instrument Settings Information on the right.

#### Managing Plate Sections

Use the  New Plate icon in the Navigation Tree to add a Plate section to an experiment. To add a Plate section:

1. In the Navigation Tree, select the section in the experiment above where you want to add a Plate section.
2. Click  **New Plate**.

A new blank Plate section displays below the section you select. Drag it to a different location in the hierarchy, if needed.

Right-click the Plate section:

&#x20;Select **Rename** to change the name of the Plate section. Use the Rename Section dialog to enter a new name for the section.

&#x20;Select **Duplicate** to copy the Plate section. When you duplicate a Plate section, the new Plate section contains all the settings from the original Plate section, without data.

&#x20;Select **Delete** to delete the Plate section.

When you select a Plate section in the Navigation Tree, the Plate section settings display in the Workspace and the section toolbar displays the following icons:

The Home tab provides:

&#x20;**Template Tools** - Contains the Template Editor icon described above plus icons to  Copy,  Paste,  Import, and  Export template data. See Template Tools on page 89.

#### Cloning Plates

Use plate clones to apply multiple templates and reductions to the same set of raw data. You can add as many plate clones as needed to the Plate section. Plate clones display in tabs at the top of the Plate section. The first tab on the left is the original plate. Each plate clone tab displays the original plate name followed by the number of the clone.

To clone a plate:

1. In the Navigation Tree, select the Plate section that contains the plate to clone.
2. Select the Home tab and click  **Clone Plate** in the Plate Tools. The Plate section displays the plate clone as a tab next to the original plate name.
3. Click the tab for the plate clone to make the plate clone active in the section.
4. To delete a plate clone, click the **X** in the clone tab.

#### Copying Plate Data

You can copy plate data from one Plate section to a different Plate section within the same document or between different documents. The format of the source plate data must match the format of the target Plate section. The Clone Plate feature is the most efficient way to copy plate data between Plate sections in the same document.

You can paste endpoint plate data that you copy from an external program, such as a spreadsheet or text editor when the format of the data from the external program exactly matches the format of the target Plate section.



**Note:** You can paste only endpoint data and the data is limited to one wavelength.

If the format of the data does not match the format of the target plate, a message displays and data does not paste.

The Read Information on the right indicates that the data was pasted and shows the time and date of the paste.

#### Plate Section Data Display

Plate section settings depend on the plate type you select and the actual collection of data. After you define the Plate section settings and the instrument reads the plate data, the section displays the results of the read. The precision of the data display depends on the available screen space. The values that display are a representation of the data. The software rounds the last digit that displays based on the actual data value. You can customize the data display to Numeric notation or Scientific notation format and specify the number of significant figures or decimal places. You can set these options separately for raw data andreduced data. See Collecting Data on page 108.

#### Plate Setup Helper

Use the Plate Setup Helper dialog to setup a plate to acquire data. This dialog is useful when you first learn the software because it walks you through each step to create a Plate section in sequence. However, each icon is duplicated in the Plate section toolbar and/or on the Home tab.

When you first start using the software and you select a Document tab above the Workspace, the Plate Setup Helper appears. You can also access the Plate Setup Helper from the  icon in the Plate section toolbar.

The **Configure** caption displays the name of the plate.

The **Current Instrument** caption displays the instrument to do the read.

See Data Display Options on page 204.

Select the **Do Not Open This Helper With New Protocols** check box to prevent the display of the Plate Setup Helper dialog each time you open a new document. The SoftMax Pro Options dialog has a setting to make the dialog display each time if you change your mind. See Application Options on page 45.

### Cuvette Set Sections <a href="#bookmark9" id="bookmark9"></a>

Use Cuvette Set sections to define cuvette related instrument settings, data reduction settings, and data display settings from instruments that have a cuvette port. You can create as many Cuvette Set sections as you need and each Cuvette Set section can contain up to 96 cuvettes. Cuvettes are read one at a time.

Cuvette Set sections contain a cuvette data display, instrument Settings Information on the right, and Reduction Settings below the data display. The software numbers the cuvettes in a Cuvette Set section as if they were wells in a plate. The first 12 cuvettes are numbers A1 through A12, and then the next cuvette is number B1. This representation matches the software data analysis capabilities. If colors appear in the cuvette data display, the Cuvette Set section contains templates. You assign each group in the template a different color and the Group section table displays the corresponding color. After a read, Read Information displays below the instrument Settings Information on the right.

#### Managing Cuvette Set Sections

Use the  New Cuvette Set icon in the Navigation Tree to add a Cuvette Set section to an experiment.

To add a Cuvette Set section:

&#x20; **Hide Replicates** - Click to hide replicates in the table. Click  to select the columnsto display again.

#### Summary Formula Tools

Use formulas to create data analysis templates that automate the analysis and results for experiments. Use the Formula Editor dialog to add and edit Summary formulas in Group sections. Summary formulas typically reduce data to a single value or array.

For a complete guide to formulas and their use, select the Help tab and click **Formula Reference**.

&#x20;To create a new Summary formula, click  in the section toolbar or click  **New Summary** on the Home tab.

&#x20;To edit a Summary formula, double-click in a frame that contains a formula or click a frame and click  **Edit Summary** on the Home tab.

&#x20;To copy a Summary formula to the clipboard, click a frame that contains a formula and click  **Copy** on the Home tab.

&#x20;To paste the Summary formula to a new location, click where you want to paste the formula and click  **Paste** on the Home tab.

&#x20;To delete a Summary formula, click a frame that contains a formula (Ctrl+click to multi- select) and click  **Delete** on the Home tab.

By default, Summary formulas in the Group section display the result of the formula without displaying the actual formula. You can show or hide the formula with the result.

&#x20;Click  in the section toolbar or click  **Show Formulas** on the Home tab to display all formulas in the active Group section.

&#x20;Click  in the section toolbar or click  **Hide Formulas** on the Home tab to hide all formulas in the section.

You can copy a formula or column from one area of the program to a different area or from one experiment to a different experiment. After you paste a formula you can edit the copy. You can copy and paste formulas in contiguous column formulas as a unit.

#### Frames

Group sections can contain frames. Group section frames are identical to Note section frames except you cannot enter images in a Group section. See Note Sections on page 70.

#### Formatting Tools

The Formatting Tools for a Group section are the same as the Formatting Tools for a Notessection.

### Graph Sections

Use Graph sections to plot information as a scatter plot graph or a bar graph. You can create custom graphs and you can graph the data from Group section tables. You can use columns in a Group section table as the X or Y input for plots on a graph in a Graph section. The Graph section can use data from any Group section in the document and you can create as many Graph sections as you need.

Graph sections contain either a scatter plot graph or a bar graph. Scatter plot graphs have a legend area and curve fit results. You can define Graph sections at any point in the data collection process but graphs tend to be more relevant for data analysis.

#### Managing Graph Sections

Use the  New Graph icon in the Navigation Tree to add a Graph section to an experiment. To add a Graph section:

1. In the Navigation Tree, select the section in the experiment above where you want to add a Graph section.
2. Click  **New Graph**.
3. Use the Plot Editor dialog to create the graph. See Graphing Data on page 212.

After you click OK in the Plot Editor dialog, a new Graph section displays below the section you select in the Navigation Tree. Drag it to a different location in the hierarchy, if needed.

Right-click the Graph section:

&#x20;Select **Rename** to change the name of the Graph section.  Select **Duplicate** to copy the Graph section.

&#x20;Select **Delete** to delete the Graph section.

When you select a Graph section in the Navigation Tree, the Graph section settings display in the Workspace and the section toolbar contains the following icons:

* Click to display the Plot Editor dialog to edit the graph.
* Click to display the Graph Appearance dialog to label the axes and other display options. See Graph Appearance on page 219.

&#x20;**Category** - Click the drop-down and select a category (scatter plot graphs only).

&#x20;**Fit** - Click the drop-down and select a fit (scatter plot graphs only).

* Click to display the Curve Fit Settings dialog to define curve fits. See Curve Fit Settings on page 221.

The Home tab provides:

&#x20;**Graph Types** - Contains icons to switch between a  Scatter graph and a  Bar graph.

&#x20;**Graph Tools** - Contains the icons described above plus an  Export Graph icon to export graph data to an image format file.

### Templates

Templates provide the link between raw data and analysis groups. A template uses a map of the wells in the plate you assign to a Plate section or the cuvettes in a Cuvette Set section to allow you to identify the wells that are blanks, replicates, samples, and groups. Groups appear as Group sections in the Navigation Tree. Template tools provide access to the Template Editor dialog where you create groups and templates. See Template Editor on page 87.

Each template contains samples and groups:

&#x20;A set of one or more replicate wells makes up a sample.  A set of related samples forms a group.

Example: You can have a group named “Standards” that contains seven samples named STD01, STD02, …, STD07, and a group named “Unknowns” that contains five samples named UNK01, UNK02, …, UNK05.

Each sample is applied to a column or some other subset of wells on a plate or to one or more cuvettes. Each well you designate to be part of a group has a group name, a sample name (or replicate ID), a sample descriptor (optional), and a column format for the formula calculations and data reports you define in the corresponding Group section. Samples and groups can exist across multiple Plate sections and Cuvette Set sections.

#### Template Editor <a href="#bookmark13" id="bookmark13"></a>

The Template Editor displays a representation of the plate type or the set of cuvettes as a grid. Use the grid to designate the location of blanks, standards, controls, unknowns, empty wells, or to assign wells/cuvettes to groups that become Group sections in an experiment.

The Template Editor for a Cuvette Set section displays a grid with 96 cells in the column and row format of a 96-well plate. The software numbers the cuvettes in the template as if they were wells in a plate. This representation corresponds with the data analysis capabilities of the software. When you add a group to a Cuvette Set section template, you add cuvettes to the Cuvette Set section.

To import a template file or to export a template to a document for use in future experiments, see Template Tools on page 89.

Each Plate section and Cuvette Set section can have one template. If the section contains a template, the Template Editor displays the existing template when you click .

To manage templates:

1. In the Navigation Tree, select a Plate section or Cuvette Set section.
2. Click  in the section toolbar, on the Home tab, or in the Plate Setup Helper dialog to display the Template Editor dialog.
3. Select a **View** option:

&#x20;Select **Sample Name** to display the sample name in the wells in the grid.  Select **Descriptor** to display the descriptor information only.

1. Drag the cursor across the grid to select wells. When you select multiple wells, the selection must be a rectangular group of contiguous wells.
2. Click one of the following:

&#x20;In the Assignment Options area, click **Plate Blank** (Plate sections) or **Blank** (Cuvette Set sections) to specify wells/cuvettes as blanks. The software does not add a group in the Groups area. For Kinetic and Spectrum data, the software averages and subtracts the blank value from each point in the read.

&#x20;In the Groups area, click **Add** to create a Group section. The Group Settings dialog displays. See Group Settings on page 92.

1. After you complete the fields in the Group Settings dialog, use the Template Editor to do the following for a group.

&#x20;Select a group and click **Edit** to display the Group Settings dialog where you can edit the group settings.

&#x20;Select a group and click **Delete** to delete the group from the template and to delete the Group section from the Navigation Tree.

&#x20;Select a group and click **Plate Blank** or click **Group Blank**.

&#x20;To specify wells as group blank, select the wells, click **Group Blank**, and then click **Assign**. Select the wells or cuvettes to use for the group blank. These should be wells or cuvettes you want to assign to a group, but not the “Blank” group. Select a group from the **Group Types** list. Click **Group Blank** and then click **Assign**

&#x20;Select a group, select additional wells, and then click **Assign** to add the wells to the group.

&#x20;Select a group, select wells, and then click **Series** to display the Series dialog where you define a series. See Creating a Series on page 94.

&#x20;Select wells in one or more groups and click **Copy** to copy the well assignments to the clipboard. Use this to duplicate well assignments within the current template. You can also paste the same sample names but create new groups. You can copy only contiguous wells in the template. Then click in the well at the corner of the paste area or highlight the paste area and click **Paste** to display a menu. To copy and paste an entire template to a different experiment section see Template Tools on page 89.

&#x20;Select **Paste** to add the new wells to the current group.

&#x20;Select **Paste With New Group** to have the wells create a new group in the Groups list.

&#x20;Select wells that are in a group and click **Clear** to remove the wells from the group. If you clear all the wells you assign to a group, the group continues to display in the Groups area and the Group section continues to display in the Navigation Tree.

1. Select a group then click the **Sample** drop-down and select a sample. In the

**Concentration** field, enter the concentration.

1. Click **Print** to print the Template Editor dialog. You must click OK to save the template before you can print.
2. Click **OK**.

### Blanks

Use the Template Editor to configure plate blanks (Plate sections), blanks (Cuvette Set sections), and group blanks. You can use blanks in combination and have cumulative effects.

Use plate blanks and blanks when you prepare all samples on the plate in the same way. You can turn off plate blank subtraction in the Data Reduction dialog to review data with or without plate blank subtraction. See Data Reduction on page 193. Use plate blanks to correct reads when you prepare all samples on a plate in the same buffer or matrix, and therefore can use the same correction value. The software subtracts plate blanks from the raw data or after pathlength correction if you use PathCheck® Pathlength Measurement Technology. For Kinetic and Spectrum data, the software averages and subtracts the blank value from each point in the read. For Cuvettes Sets blanks, the software subtracts the average value of all cuvettes in a blank group from individual cuvette reads in the same Cuvette Set section.

Template blanks are subtracted after the cuvette reference read is subtracted.

In a plate blank group the software subtracts the average value of all the wells in the blank group from each individual well value in the plate. If you have an instrument that supports PathCheck Pathlength Measurement Technology, the software subtracts the Plate Blank after pathlength correction.

### Group Blanks (Plates and Cuvettes)

Use group blanks to correct reads when you prepare samples on a plate in a different buffer or matrix, and therefore need to be individually corrected. Group blanks can be subtracted from raw data, like plate blank, or after post-reduction calculations, for example, wavelength, kinetic reduction, and so on. You can assign blank wells within a group, other than the “Blank” group.

The software subtracts the group blank when you assign a group blank and you do not have the option to review the uncorrected data. To see the reduced number without the group blank subtracted, you must mask the group blank wells or cuvettes. See Masking Wells or Cuvettes on page 210.

Group blanks apply to all wells or cuvettes in a group and can be subtracted from wells orcuvettes in more than one Plate section or Cuvette Set section.

#### Template Tools

For a Plate section, use the Home tab Template Tools to copy a template and then paste the template to another Plate section in the document or even to a comparable section in a different document. Both Plate sections must have the same plate type. If the destination Plate section contains a template, Paste overwrites the existing template with the template copy.

To copy a template:

&#x20; **Copy** - Select the source Plate section in the Navigation Tree and click  **Copy** to copy the template from the active Plate section to the clipboard.

&#x20; **Paste** - Select the destination Plate section in the Navigation Tree and click  **Paste**.

&#x20;Select **Paste** to paste only the template settings without the groups.  Select **Paste With New Groups** to paste the template and its groups.

When you copy a template from one experiment and paste it into a different experiment, the group names and sample names of the destination template will be identical to those of the source template. Since they are in different experiments, the full name is different.

For example, group@experiment#2 instead of group@experiment#1.

&#x20;Changes made to the template in the destination Plate section have no effect on the source Plate section.

&#x20;Data from the two Plate sections are not analyzed together.

When you copy a template from a Plate section in an experiment to a different Plate section in the same experiment, the destination template is an extension of the source template. All wells in the destination section are considered replicates of the wells in the source section, with the same group and sample names.

&#x20;Changes you make to the template in the destination Plate section are also made to the template in the source Plate section.

&#x20;Data from the two Plate sections are analyzed together.

### Import and Export

On the Home tab, use the Template Tools to import template information into a Plate section from a tab-delimited ASCII text file in Unicode (UTF-8) format. You can prepare template files outside the SoftMax Pro Software and then import the file when you are ready to run samples.

**Tip:** To determine the correct format to import a template, export a template from the SoftMax Pro Software and examine the contents of the resulting file.



To import a template:

1. In the Navigation Tree, select the destination Plate section.
2. On the Home tab, click  **Import** to display the Open dialog.
3. Navigate to and select the \<template>.txt file to import.
4. Click **Open**.

To export a template:

1. In the Navigation Tree, select the source Plate section.
2. On the Home tab, click  **Export** to display the Save As dialog.
3. Navigate to the location where you want to save the template file.
4. In the **File Name** field, enter a name for the file.
5. Click the **Save As Type** drop-down and select **Text files (\*.txt)** or **Excel files (\*xls)**. Text files save in tab delimited format.
6. Click **Save**.

### Template File Format

When you save template data as a tab delimited ASCII text file in Unicode (UTF-8) format, the template file consists of ten columns of data separated by tabs. Each line of the file provides information for a single well in the plate.

When you export template information, the first line of data contains template information for well A1, the second line of data contains template information for well A2, and so on, until a line is created in the export file for each well in the plate. If no template information exists for a well in a plate, the corresponding line in the file is left blank.

The order of the import template information must match the export order. Blank lines in the file are assigned to a well to provide a well with no template setting.

#### ASCII Template File Columns and Descriptions

| **Col** | **Column Entry**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

\* The µ symbol can be imported only if the ASCII text file is saved in Unicode (UTF-8) format.

You can open a tab delimited ASCII file with a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel.

**Note:** Do not edit the file in Excel because the SoftMax Pro Software import only supports the format for files you save as an ASCII text file in Unicode (UTF-8) format.



#### Group Settings <a href="#bookmark15" id="bookmark15"></a>

Use the Group Settings dialog to define the name for a group of related samples, a descriptor related to the samples, and the initial column format for the data calculated and reported in a Group section.

Use the Template Editor to assign wells to groups. Some protocols automatically create groups such as Standard or Unknown. When you create a group in the Template Editor dialog, (even if you do not select wells in the template), a Group section is added in the Navigation Tree for the experiment. To delete a group, you must delete the Group section. When you clear a group from the Template Editor, you only remove the assignment of wells from that group name. Clearing a group does not delete the group.

To define group settings:

1. In the Navigation Tree, select a Plate section or Cuvette Set section.
2. Click  in the section toolbar, on the Home tab, or in the Plate Setup Helper dialog to display the Template Editor dialog.
3. Drag the cursor to select one or more wells. In the Groups area, click **Add** or select a group and click **Edit** to display the Group Setting dialog.
4. In the **Group Name** field, enter the name to assign to the group.
5. Click **Set Color** and select the color to display for the wells in the group.
6. Select a **Group Table Layout** option. The Group Table Column Preview shows how the columns will display in the table in the Group section. The Columns and Formulas table on the following page summarizes the formulas associated with each column.

&#x20;Select **Standards** to create a group with the following group table columns: Sample, Well, Concentration, Values, Mean Value, Standard Deviation, and CV%. The Concentration column becomes the **Sample Descriptor1** by default under the assumption that the Group section will contain concentration information. You can use this column for numerical data such as dilution factor or fraction number.

&#x20;Select **Unknowns** to create a group with the following group table columns: Sample, Well, Values, Result, Mean Result, Standard Deviation, and CV%.

**Note:** The Unknowns group does not have a sample descriptor by default. You can select the respective check boxes to add one or two sample descriptors and then enter the descriptive information.



Select **Custom** to create a group with the following group table columns: Sample, Well, Values, Mean Value, Standard Deviation, and CV%.

**Note:** The Custom group does not have a sample descriptor by default. You can select the respective check boxes to add one or two sample descriptors and then enter the descriptive information.



1. In the Add Columns area, select the **Sample Descriptor1** check box if you want to use the descriptor. When you select the Standards Group Table Layout this is selected by default and the column Name defaults to Concentration.
2. In the **Column Name** field, enter the name of the sample descriptor.

**Note:** If you plan to reference the name of this column in a formula, do not use reserved characters or names of operators, functions, or accessors in the formula name. For information about reserved characters and words, see “Formula Rules” in the _SoftMax Pro Data Acquisition and Analysis Software Formula Reference Guide_.



1. Click the **Units** drop-down and select the unit of measure.
2. Select the **Sample Descriptor2** check box to add a second sample descriptor column to the table.

**Note:** The Sample Descriptor you assign in the Group settings dialog yields group table columns that you cannot edit. To create editable sample descriptor columns, add new columns and enter a formula such as: !Sampledescriptor,



!factor, !concentration.

1. Click **OK** to close the Group Settings dialog. The software places the wells you select in the new group.
2. Click **Series** to display the Series dialog where you define a series for the wells you select.
3. Click **OK** to close the Template Editor and apply the template.

### Group Table Layout - Default Columns

The Group Table Layout you select defines which columns are in the Group section table. The following lists the default column names and each column's formula for the Standard, Unknown, or Custom Group Table Layouts.

#### Columns and Formulas

| **Column Name** | **Formula**                         | **Standard** | **Unknown**  | **Custom**   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |

| CV%             | Cv(Result)                          |              | yMiGTor5IidT |              |

**Creating a Series**

Use the Series dialog to define several samples as a series. Use a series to enter incremental sample descriptors (e.g., dilutions or concentrations) and sample names to a template when the increment can be expressed as a mathematical operation. When you work with groups of wells in the template, the standard value or dilution factor increases or decreases in specific steps. The series name can also increment.

A series is defined in one direction (starting from left, right, top, or bottom) and therefore you must configure samples sequentially in either ascending or descending order.

To create a series:

1. In the Navigation Tree, select a Plate section or Cuvette Set section.
2. Click  in the section toolbar, on the Home tab, or in the Plate Setup Helper dialog to display the Template Editor dialog.
3. In the Template Editor dialog, click and drag the mouse to select wells to be part of the series.
4. In the **Groups** area, select a group name.
5. Click **Series** to display the Series dialog.
6. In the Series Layout area select a **Start From** option for how the series fills the wells.
7. In Patterns of Replicates area, enter the number of replicates in the **X-Direction** field and enter the number of replicates in the **Y-Direction** field.

The maximum number of replicates depends on the well selection. For example, if you fill down from the top and you choose a block of wells that is 4 wells wide by 8 wells high, the maximum number of replicates is four. With the same block of wells selected, filling from the left would permit eight replicates. If the number of replicates you choose does not divide evenly into the number of rows or columns you select, depending on the filling direction, the remaining wells that cannot contain replicates are labeled as more individual wells in the series. To create a series that includes all the wells in the plate, select all the wells, select the fill direction, and then set the replicates to 1.

1. Select the **Reverse Series Order** check box to reverse the order of the series.
2. In the Sample Information area, in the **Starting Sample Name** field, enter the name of the first sample in the series. Subsequent replicates use this name as a base and either increment the number within the name or append a number to it.
3. Select the **Concentration** check box to increment the sample name and the concentration. Leave this check box clear to increment only the names of a series of samples without incrementing the concentration or dilution. If you select this check box, the following two fields are available:
   1. In the **Starting Value** field, enter a value for the descriptor if a you define a sample descriptor for the group.
   2. Click the **Step By** drop-down and select the operator for the series (+, -, \*, or /) and then enter a value for the increment. For example, with a starting value of 0.5, the division operator (/) and the increment 2, the series starts with 0.5 and divides each subsequent sample by 2 to produce the series 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and so on.

**Note:** To increment the names of a series of samples with a constant concentration or dilution, click the **Step By** drop-down and select the multiplication operator (\*) and then enter a value of 1 for the increment.



1. Click **OK**.

### Formulas

Formulas are powerful data analysis tools that can automate the analysis and results reporting for plate reads. Formulas are mathematical functions you create with operators and accessors to convert and analyze raw data for presentation in the appropriate output format. See Formula Editor on page 98.

The software includes many formulas to expedite data analysis. The formulas in the software use a hierarchical naming structure, much like the directories and sub directories in computer file systems. All objects (for example, columns, Summaries, wells, graphs, plots) in the SoftMax Pro Software have names. You use these names to refer to the objects when you write formulas.

The _SoftMax Pro Data Acquisition and Analysis Software Formula Reference Guide_ identifies and enumerates the details about formulas, operators, functions, and accessors that you can use. Select the Help tab and click **Formula Reference**.

&#x20;You can use Summary formulas in Group sections and Note sections to reduce data to a single value or array.

&#x20;You can use Reduction formulas in Plate sections and Cuvette Set sections to apply a formula to the entire section.

&#x20;You can use Column formulas in Group sections to apply a formula to each column in the section.

&#x20;You can assign formulas to the X and Y axes in a Graph section.

#### Operators

Use operators to combine other formula building blocks together. Operators let you combine and compare numbers, functions, accessors, and text strings in a variety of ways within formulas. Most operators are mathematical symbols, e.g. +, -, \*, /, <. > etc. Boolean operators have text, e.g. If, And, Or, Not.

#### Functions

In contrast to operators, functions have names and accept up to four parameters. They do operations such as standard deviation or slope. You can input zero to four parameters into functions. You can use lists of numbers, arrays of numbers, and lists of text strings as input parameters, and the function can return either lists or arrays of numbers or text. Functions return numbers, text, or Booleans.

The general format for a function is:

FunctionName(Parameter1, Parameter2, Parameter3, Parameter4)

If a function has more than one parameter, the order in which you list parameters is extremely important. If you enter the parameters in the incorrect order, the function returns erroneous results.

#### Accessors

Accessors are special functions that provide access to other specific information in the software. For example, the number of Vmax Points used to calculate the Vmax Rate. Accessors are frequently used by themselves as column formulas. They are also used as parameters within several functions, most notably kinetic and spectrum reduction functions. Accessors can be combined with functions and mathematical operators to create complex formulas.

Unlike functions, accessors do not have related parameters. Accessors are always preceded by an exclamation point (!, also known as a “bang”).

### Formula Rules

The following is a very high level summary of formula rules:

&#x20;Formulas are not case sensitive.

&#x20;If an object’s name contains a space, starts with a number, or includes one or more of the following special characters: # $ % / \* ?, the name must be enclosed in single quotation marks. For example, ‘OD Values’. Do not use ^ @ \~ or & in object names because these characters have special meanings in the software.

&#x20;When create you a formula that references columns in more than one Group section, make sure the Group sections all have the same number of rows (samples).

&#x20;Column formulas must evaluate either to text, to numbers, or to a Boolean (for example, to True or False) because a column cannot contain text (“Pass”) and numeric (“1.002”) results.

&#x20;When a formula includes a text result that you want to display, the result must beenclosed in double quotation marks, for example, “Out of Range”.

#### Formula Editor

Use the Formula Editor dialog to create formulas that convert and analyze raw data for presentation in the appropriate output format. Use formulas to create powerful data analysis templates that can automate the analysis and results reporting for experiments.

There are several types of formulas:

&#x20;You can use Summary formulas in Group sections and Note sections to reduce data to a single value or array.

&#x20;You can use Reduction formulas in Plate sections and Cuvette Set sections to apply a formula to the entire section.

&#x20;You can use Column formulas in Group sections to apply a formula to each column in the section.

&#x20;You can assign formulas to the X and Y axes in a Graph section. The Formula Editor dialog varies based on how you access the dialog.

To create formulas:

1. There are several ways to access the Formula Editor.

&#x20;In the Navigation Tree, select a Note Section or a Group section. In the section toolbar click , on the Home tab click  **New Summary**, or select a formula in a section and click **Edit Summary**. This is a Summary formula.

&#x20;In the Navigation Tree, select a Plate section or a Cuvette Set section. Click  in the section toolbar, the Reduction Settings area, or on the Home tab. In the Data Reduction dialog select **Custom** from a drop-down and click . This is a Reduction formula. See Data Reduction on page 193.

&#x20;In the Navigation Tree, select a Group section. In the section toolbar click , double-click a column header, or on the Home tab click  **New** or click  **Edit** in the Column Tools. This is a Column formula.

&#x20;In the Navigation Tree, select a Graph section or in the Navigation Tree click  **New Graph**. In the section toolbar click  or on the Home tab click  **Plot Editor**. In the Plot Editor dialog in the Data Input area, click the **X-Axis** or **Y-Axis** drop-down and select **Custom** and then click .

**Note:** The following steps describe the flow for Summary formulas. The Formula Editor has fewer fields for other formula types but the workflow for the Formula field is the same for all formulas.



1. In the **Name** field, enter the formula name. You can display the name and/or description in the Note/Group section. To not display the formula name in the section, select the **Hide Name** check box.

**Note:** If you plan to reference this formula in a different formula, for example referencing the formula in a column of a group table, do not use reserved characters or names of operators, functions, or accessors in the formula name. For information about reserved characters and words, see “Formula Rules” in the _SoftMax Pro Data Acquisition and Analysis Software Formula Reference Guide_.



1. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the formula. This displays in the section and can be left blank.
2. In the **Comments** field, enter a comment to annotate the formula. This displays only in the Formula Editor dialog.
3. Select the **Syntax Helper** check box to display the Syntax Helper formula completion tool. The Syntax Helper displays the formulas that are available and the parameters each formula expects to receive.

**Tip:** When you start to enter a formula, a list displays below the text as you type. The Syntax Helper analyzes text as you type and compares it to formulas that are available for use in the software.



1. In the **Formula** field, enter the formula.
2. Click **Check Syntax** to check the validity of the formula. A message displays to help you troubleshoot the formula syntax.

&#x20;Select **Decimal Places** and enter the number of decimal places to display.

1. Click **OK**.

### Defining and Running Workflows <a href="#bookmark19" id="bookmark19"></a>

Use workflows to define complex reads such as multitask kinetic reads that last hours or days. Use the Workflow view of the Workspace to drag-and-drop tasks into a timeline. The Workflow tab in the Ribbon contains the icons to execute and monitor the workflow.

Pause a workflow to work with other features in the software, such as define protocols or run short reads, while the software waits to do the next non-timing task in the workflow. When you pause a workflow, all delays and cycle timings continue to run. When the workflow reaches a non-timing task, such as a read, the task starts after you resume the workflow. If you resume the workflow after the scheduled time for a task to start, then the task starts when you resume the workflow and all subsequent tasks are rescheduled to a later time.

For example, if a delay before a read is set for 30 minutes and you resume the workflow after 40 minutes, then the read starts when you resume the workflow and all subsequent tasks are rescheduled to start 10 minutes later than their original times.

To define and run a workflow:

*
  1. Open a document in the Workspace.
  2. Select the **Document** view of the Workspace and create the experiments with the applicable sections. You can define the acquisition settings for each Plate section from the Workflow view.
  3. Select the **Workflow** view of the Workspace. The Ribbon automatically displays the Workflow tab.
  4. Drag tasks from the Navigation Tree on the left into the timeline on the right.

&#x20;To repeat Kinetic tasks, place the tasks to repeat in a Cycle task.

&#x20;To gather data over long periods of time, use a Kinetic read type and then define the Timing settings to acquire a single point with each read. See Timing Settings on page 123.

**Note:** Place only Kinetic reads within a cycle. If you place other read types in a cycle, the software overwrites the previously acquired data in the Plate section. You can place an Endpoint, Well Scan, Spectrum, or Flex read before or after a cycle to preserve the acquired data.



&#x20;Click **Undo** to undo the most recent change you made to the timeline.  Click **Redo** to redo an action.

&#x20;Click **Clear** to clear the timeline and start over.

&#x20;Click **Zoom In** to zoom in to the Workflow view similar to using the slider on the bottom right.

&#x20;Click **Zoom Out** to zoom out of the Workflow view.

&#x20;Click **Reset Zoom** to set the zoom to the default setting.

&#x20;Click **Fit To Screen** to set the view so that the workflow fits on the screen without scroll bars.

&#x20;Click **Mini Map** to display the Overview dialog that helps you navigate a long timeline.

&#x20;Click **Save As Image** to export an image of the timeline to an image file with the .jpg,

.png, .gif, or .xps format.

&#x20;Click  **Pause** to temporarily stop the workflow.  Click  **Resume** to restart the paused workflow.  Click  **Cancel** to cancel the workflow.

*
  1. Click  **Execution Log** to view the status of the tasks that were executed including thetime, step name, and related messages

### Workflow Task Settings

Each task in the workflow allows you to define settings that are applicable for that task.

1. Select a task in the timeline.
2. Click  to edit the settings for that task.

### Read Task Settings

Use the read task settings to select the experiment and Plate section you define from the Document view of the Workspace.

To define read task settings:

1. Click the **Experiment** drop-down and select the experiment that contains the Plate section to read.
2. Click the **Plate Section** drop-down and select a Plate section.
3. The read uses the acquisition settings you define for the Plate section. To edit the acquisition settings, click . See Acquisition Settings on page 109.

**Tip:** If you place a Kinetic read task in a Cycle for the SpectraMax iD3, SpectraMax iD5, SpectraMax i3x, SpectraMax Paradigm, FilterMax F3, and FilterMax F5, clear the **Show Pre-Read Optimization Options** check box. Pre-Read optimization requires user interaction. If you select this check box, the software waits for user interaction before each read. See Show Pre-Read Optimization Options on page 143.



### Open Drawer Task Settings

To define drawer task settings:

1. Select the **Wait While Drawer is Open** check box to pause the workflow until the drawer is closed. Leave the check box clear if you require the workflow to continue to the next task with the drawer open.
2. In the **Message to Show** field, enter the message to display when the drawer opens or enter instructions for the operator.

### Set Temperature Task Settings

To define set temperature settings:

1. Select **On** and in the **Plate Chamber Set Point** field, enter the temperature to turn on the read chamber incubator, or select **Off** to turn off temperature control.
2. Select the **Wait While the Temperature Changes** check box to pause the workflow until the read chamber reaches the set point. Leave the check box clear if you require the workflow to continue to the next task before the chamber reaches its set point.

### Shake Task Settings

To define shake task settings:

&#x20;In the **Shake time** field, enter the number of seconds to shake the plate.

### Delay Task Settings

To define delay task settings:

&#x20;Enter values for the delay in Days:Hours:Minutes:Seconds, or click a value and use the arrows on the right.



**Note:** The Delay task continues even when you pause the workflow.

### Cycle Task Settings

The number of cycles is calculated based on how many Cycle Intervals can be completed within the Total Run Time.

When you define the timing for a cycle, make sure that the tasks in the cycle finish within the time you allot. The workflow editor does not calculate the time it takes to do a read. If the read takes longer than the time you allot for the cycle, then the next cycle begins immediately after the cycle tasks complete.

To define cycle task settings:

*
  1. To include a task in the cycle, drag the task between the start and end points of the cycle task.
  2. In the **Total Run Time** field, enter values in Days:Hours:Minutes:Seconds to define the total time for all the cycles to complete.
  3. In the **Cycle Interval** field, enter values in Days:Hours:Minutes:Seconds to define the time from the start of one cycle to the start of the next cycle.



**Note:** The cycle interval continues even when you pause the workflow.
