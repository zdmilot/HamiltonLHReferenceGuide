# ScanLater Western Blot TRF Read Mode

Protein detection is an important task for pharmaceutical and clinical research, and Western Blots (WB), or protein immunoblots, are one of the most common methods employed for this purpose. Various techniques are used to detect proteins on Western Blot membranes including fluorescence, silver staining, and chemiluminescence. However, each technique has its limitations, and there is a continuous need to improve quantitation, accuracy, and dynamic range of Western Blots.

The Molecular Devices ScanLater™ Western Blot Assay Kit is a novel system for protein analysis that can be used with the SpectraMax Paradigm, SpectraMax i3x, and SpectraMax iD5. Membranes are incubated with Eu-chelate labeled secondary antibodies or streptavidin that bind specifically to the target protein-specific primary antibody. Europium has a long fluorescence lifetime, on the order of 1 msec, and detection is done in Time Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) mode which significantly reduces background from auto-fluorescence or other sources of short lifetime emissions. The membranes are placed into the instrument where they are scanned with the ScanLater Western Blot (WB) Detection Cartridge.

The method does not involve enzyme detection, and the Eu-chelates are resistant to photo- bleaching, so the signal remains stable for long periods of time (weeks to months). This allows you repeat the read of membranes and the potential for comparison of band intensities to known standards for more accurate quantitation. There is also no camera blooming, as can occur with chemiluminescence or fluorescence detection, so the system gives sharp bands and excellent image quality.

The TRF detection employs photon counting, so the theoretical dynamic range is >10 . In practice, however, dynamic range is limited by saturation of binding sites on high-abundant bands and non-specific binding to background membrane.

The SpectraMax Western Blot system is a simple, sensitive, and stable platform that provides excellent Western Blot capability for the SpectraMax Paradigm, SpectraMax i3x, and SpectraMax iD5 to extend the uses of these essential laboratory instruments.

### Western Blot TRF Instruments and Detection Cartridges

The following instruments have Western Blot TRF read mode capability:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/11 (9).png>) SpectraMax iD5 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader on page 320 (requires the Enhanced TRF module)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/12 (8).png>) SpectraMax i3x and SpectraMax i3 Multi-Mode Detection Platforms, see page 323 (i3x requires the ScanLater Western Blot (WB) Detection Cartridge)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/13 (7).png>) SpectraMax Paradigm Multi-Mode Microplate Reader, see page 327 (requires the ScanLater Western Blot (WB) Detection Cartridge)

The ScanLater Western Blot (WB) Detection Cartridge can be used for top reads only.

### Analyzing Western Blot TRF Data

After you scan a membrane for Western Blot data, the data displays in the software as an image. Use the image tools in the Plate section to zoom, crop, colorize, and adjust the intensity of the image. You can select a region of interest (ROI) and rescan the membrane at a higher resolution. See Viewing Western Blot Membrane Data on page 241.

Western Blot membrane data is saved as a TIFF image to allow you to use the image analysis tool of your choice for analysis. The SoftMax Pro Software includes a version of the ImageJ software from U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH). See Analyzing Western Blot Images on page 246.

For best results, use the Molecular Devices ScanLater™ Western Blot Assay Kit that matches your application.

### Blocking Nonspecific Binding

To reduce noise, use blocking buffer to reduce non-specific protein from binding with the membrane.

No single-blocking reagent is optimal for every antigen-antibody pair. Some primary antibodies can exhibit greatly reduced signal or different nonspecific binding in different blocking solutions. If you have difficulty detecting your target protein, changing the blocking solution can dramatically improve the performance. If the primary antibody has worked well in the past using chemiluminescent detection, try that same blocking solution for detection. Other commonly used blocking buffers other than BSA are 3% casein and 5% non-fat milk.

Milk-based blockers can contain IgG that can cross react with anti-goat antibodies. This can significantly increase background and reduce antibody titer. Milk-based blockers can also contain endogenous biotin or phosphoepitopes that can cause higher background.

To prevent background speckles on blots, use high-quality, ultra-pure water for buffers.

Do not over-block. Extended blocking times can cause loss of target protein from the membrane.

### Handling Membranes

To scan a membrane, you must first place it in a Molecular Devices ScanLater™ membrane holder. See Loading the Membrane Holder on page 176.

**Note:** Handle membranes by their edges only, using clean forceps. Do not touch the membrane with gloved or bare hands.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/14 (8).png>)

The maximum size of a membrane that will fit in the membrane holder is 109 mm x 77 mm.

The Western Blot should be prepared using standard blotting procedures for the membrane being used. For optimal results, use Millipore Immobilon FL (IPFL00010). If using PVDF, pre- wet the membrane in 100% methanol.

Use enough antibody volume so that the entire membrane surface is sufficiently covered with liquid at all times. Use heat-seal bags if the volume is limiting. Do not let an area of the membrane dry out. Use agitation for all antibody incubations.

Small proteins can pass through the membrane during transfer (“blow-through”). To prevent this, use a membrane with a smaller pore size or reduce the transfer time.

Allow the blot to dry for a minimum of 1 hour before detection. Do not wrap the membrane in plastic when scanning.
