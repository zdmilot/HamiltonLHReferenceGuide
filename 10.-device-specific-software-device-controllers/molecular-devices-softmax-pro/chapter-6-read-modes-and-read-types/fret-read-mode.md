# FRET Read Mode

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a distance-dependent interaction between the electronic excited states of two dye molecules in which excitation is transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule _without emission of a photon_.

FRET relies on the distance-dependent transfer of energy from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. Due to its sensitivity to distance, FRET has been used to investigate molecular interactions. FRET is the radiationless transmission of energy from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. The donor molecule is the dye or chromophore that initially absorbs the energy and the acceptor is the chromophore to which the energy is subsequently transferred. This resonance interaction occurs over greater than interatomic distances, without conversion to thermal energy, and without a molecular collision. The transfer of energy leads to a reduction in the fluorescence intensity and excited state lifetime of the donor, and an increase in the emission intensity of the acceptor. A pair of molecules that interact in such a manner that FRET occurs is often referred to as a donor/acceptor pair.

While there are many factors that influence FRET, the primary conditions that need to be met for FRET to occur are relatively few:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (12) (1) (1).png>) The absorption or excitation spectrum of the acceptor must overlap the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor.

The degree to which they overlap is referred to as the spectral overlap integral (J).

**FRET Instruments and Detection Cartridges**

The following instruments have FRET read mode capability:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (15) (1).png>) SpectraMax iD5 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader on page 320 (requires the Enhanced TRF module)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (13) (1).png>) SpectraMax i3x and SpectraMax i3 Multi-Mode Detection Platforms, see page 323 (the SpectraMax i3x requires the Cisbio HTRF Detection Cartridge, see page 346)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (14) (1).png>) SpectraMax Paradigm Multi-Mode Microplate Reader, see page 327 ) requires the Cisbio HTRF Detection Cartridge, see page 346)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (14).png>) FilterMax F5 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader, see page 335 ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/7 (14).png>) FilterMax F3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader on page 338
