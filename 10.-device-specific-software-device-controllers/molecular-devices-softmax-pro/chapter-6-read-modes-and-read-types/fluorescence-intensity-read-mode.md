# Fluorescence Intensity Read Mode

Fluorescence occurs when absorbed light is re-radiated at a longer wavelength. In the Fluorescence Intensity (FL) read mode, the instrument measures the intensity of the re- radiated light and expresses the result in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU).

The governing equation for fluorescence is:

Fluorescence = extinction coefficient × concentration × quantum yield × excitation intensity × pathlength × emission collection efficiency

Fluorescent materials absorb light energy of a characteristic wavelength (excitation), undergo an electronic state change, and instantaneously emit light of a longer wavelength (emission). Most common fluorescent materials have well-characterized excitation and emission spectra. The following figure shows an example of excitation and emission spectra for a fluorophore. The excitation and emission bands are each fairly broad with half-bandwidths of approximately 40 nm, and the difference between the wavelengths of the excitation and emission maxima (the Stokes shift) is generally fairly small, about 30 nm. There is considerable overlap between the excitation and emission spectra (gray area) when a small Stokes shift is present.

#### Excitation and Emission Spectra

Because the intensity of the excitation light is usually many tens of thousands of times greater than that of the emitted light, you must have sufficient spectral separation to reduce the interference of the excitation light with detection of the emitted light.

**Tip:** If the Stokes shift is small, you should choose an excitation wavelength that is as far away from the emission maximum as possible while still able to stimulate the fluorophore so that less of the excited light overlaps the emission spectrum, which permits better selection and quantitation of the emitted light.

The Spectral Optimization Wizard provides the best settings for maximizing the signal to background window, (S-B)/B, while minimizing the optimization time. You can use this wizard with the SpectraMax i3x Multi-Mode Detection Platform or with a Tunable Wavelength (TUNE) Detection Cartridge installed in the SpectraMax Paradigm Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. See Spectral Optimization on page 182.

#### Optimized Excitation and Emission Read Wavelengths

The previous figure shows that the best results are often obtained when the excitation and emission wavelengths you use for the read are not the same as the peak wavelengths of the excitation and emission spectra of the fluorophore. When the read wavelengths for excitation and emission are separated, a smaller quantity of excitation light passes through to the emission monochromator (gray area) and on to the PMT, which results in a purer emission signal and more accurate data.

The instrument allows you to scan both excitation and emission wavelengths, using separate tunable dual monochromators. One benefit of scanning emission spectra is that you can determine more accurately whether the emission is, in fact, the expected fluorophore, or multiple fluorophores, and not one generated by a variety of background sources or by contaminants. One more benefit is that you can find excitation and emission wavelengths that prevent interference when interfering fluorescent species are present.

For this reason, it is desirable to scan emission for both an intermediate concentration of labeled sample, as well as the background of unlabeled sample. The optimal setting is where the ratio of the sample emission to background emission is at the maximum.

Fluorescence intensity data is dependent on several variables.

### Applications of Fluorescence Intensity

Fluorescence intensity is used widely in applications such as fluorescent ELISAs, protein assays, nucleic acid quantitation, reporter gene assays, cell viability, cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity. One more major application is to study the kinetics of ion release.

Some assays use a fluorescent label to selectively attach to certain compounds. The quantity or concentration of the compound can then be quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the label, which is attached to the compound. Such methods are often used to quantify low concentrations of DNA or RNA, for example.

### Fluorescence Intensity Reads with Injectors

Injectors deliver a specified volume of a reagent to the wells of a plate. They are generally used when delivery of the reagent initiates a reaction that occurs rapidly and results in a luminescent or fluorescent signal that must be detected quickly.

The SpectraMax i3x with the Injector Cartridge installed can be set up to inject and read well by well to reduce signal loss.

Common inject-and-read assays include calcium flux assays.

### Background Correction and Quantification

A blank well contains everything used with the sample wells except the label and sample- specific compounds. Do not use an empty well for a blank.

The blank sample reveals the offset underlying each data sample. This offset does not carry information on the label and is generally subtracted before data reduction is done.

Within the linear detection range, the blank-subtracted raw data are proportional to the quantity of label in a sample such that the label concentration is quantified by the following equation.

where _concstd_ is the concentration of the _standard_, and _sample_, _blank_, and _std_ are average values of replicates for the sample, blank, and standard wells. In the general case where the standard curve covers a concentration range of more than a few linear logs, _(std – blank) / concstd_ is equivalent to the slope of the standard curve, and so the concentration of the label is determined by _(sample – blank) / (slope of standard curve)_.

For optimal results, you should run replicates for all blanks, controls, and samples. In this case, the blank value that will be subtracted is the average value of all blanks.

### Detection Limit

The detection limit is the smallest sample concentration that can be detected reliably above the blank. Determining the detection limit requires taking a number of blank measurements and calculating an average value and standard deviation for the blanks. The detection threshold is defined as the average blank plus three standard deviations. If the average sample value measures above the threshold, the sample can be detected at a statistically significant level.

The detection limit can be described by the following equation:

where _concstd_ is the concentration of the standard, _StDevBlank_ is the standard deviation of the blank replicates, and _blank_ and _std_ are average values of the replicates for the blank and standard wells.

Determining the detection limit for an assay requires multiple blanks to calculate their standard deviation.

### Linearity and the Linear Dynamic Range

Within a wide range at moderately high concentrations, blanked raw data is proportional to the quantity of label in a sample.

The linear dynamic range (LDR) is defined by:

( max conc lin )

LDR = log10

detec!on limit

where _LDR_ is expressed as a log, and _max conc lin_ is the highest concentration in the linear range that can be quantified.

When the standard curve after blank reduction is not linear in concentration at the lower end, there might be an incorrect or contaminated blank.

When the standard curve levels are off at the highest concentrations, this can be addressed to the inner filter effect: excitation does not reach as deep into the sample for lower concentrations, without being more significantly attenuated (absorbance) layer by layer.
