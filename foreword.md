# Foreword

Working in a lab, pipetting for hours on end, requires patience and dedication. Whether it’s analyzing clinical samples, evaluating drug efficacy, or developing a brand-new assay, the work we do tells a critical narrative about disease pathways and medical breakthroughs.



The automation of liquid handling has been pivotal in revolutionizing laboratory processes, particularly in high-throughput screening and molecular biology. Manual pipetting, once the only option, demanded precision and stamina, but as laboratories began handling larger sample volumes and more complex assays, the need for automation grew. The advent of liquid handling robots in the 1980s transformed workflows, improving accuracy, repeatability, and efficiency across the life sciences. This shift became especially crucial during the Human Genome Project (HGP), launched in 1990. Automated liquid handling systems played a key role in rapidly sequencing the 3 billion DNA base pairs of the human genome, enabling discoveries that would have taken decades using manual techniques ¹.

Today, liquid handling automation is indispensable in fields ranging from drug discovery to clinical diagnostics. Innovations like microfluidics, integrated sensors, and lab-on-a-chip technologies continue to advance the precision and miniaturization of these systems, enabling scientists to process hundreds or thousands of samples simultaneously. This progress has dramatically accelerated research and reduced human error, opening doors to new scientific insights and medical breakthroughs  .

We live in an age where machine learning has moved beyond theoretical research and become integrated into daily life. Artificial intelligence—especially generative AI—has been a rapidly growing technology, gaining traction across a wide array of business and personal applications.

As scientists, we have a responsibility to embrace and critically evaluate these advancements. AI-powered tools, which were once exclusive to specific industries, are now available to a much broader audience. While this guide to laboratory automation briefly touches on AI’s flaws and the limitations of the machine learning revolution, its primary focus is on the responsible evaluation, integration, and improvement of new technologies—just as we have done with robotics in the lab. AI is already transforming our industry, and companies like OpenAI and Google are paving the way for new innovations in information indexing, much like the early days of successful search engines.

This guide provides access to a robust knowledge base, compiled from over a decade of experience in information technology and lab automation. It also consolidates community-based knowledge and expertise from key figures in the lab automation space, helping you discover tips, tricks, and best practices to advance your work.

Although we have an organizational responsibility to protect the integrity of the Lab Automators name in meetups and groups, we do not claim exclusive ownership over this colloquialism. They have long been used informally within the community to describe professionals in our field. As lab automators, we aim to share our knowledge both within this guide and across the web to foster innovation, drive scientific breakthroughs, and strengthen our community of pioneering researchers.

We owe a great deal of gratitude to many individuals, but most notably to the team at labautomation.io. They were the catalyst for the formation of our organization and continue to serve as its backbone, providing unwavering support for our community.

This guide, while mainly focused on Hamilton, serves to teach the fundementals in liquid handling, laboratory robotics, sample and metadata structures and handling, platform integrations, and a step by step guide on how to integrate automation within your lab regardless of resourcess or budgetary constraints. Like most scientific tools, there are teirs and a spectrum of quality in the options presented to us and we all have our outside constraints and limitations, leading to an impossible one-size-fits all solution.\
