# Proteomics: Into the Fold

Proteomics, one of the foundational “-omics” fields, is the large-scale study of proteins. Proteins perform critical functions include catalyzing reactions, providing structure, and regulating biological pathways. An organism’s proteome is dynamic and responds to changing conditions of the cellular environment. This dynamism is why proteomics is both a popular and difficult field of study. Characterizing proteins is crucial to studying disease biomarkers, drug targets, or basic biological processes.

Lab automation is revolutionizing biological research by enabling faster, more scalable, and more reproducible experiments. Automation is particularly crucial in proteomics, where scientists often need to analyze thousands of proteins across many samples. If many conditions and timepoints are desired, automation is important for reducing human error and increasing throughput. By marrying technology and biology, scientists can accelerate progress in areas where understanding proteins is key.

![An example protein identification workflow: 1) A tissue sample, in this case blood, is collected and preserved. 2) The sample is treated to release proteins from the cells. Using affinity chromatography, an immobilized ligand is used to bind proteins in the sample, and then washed to remove contaminants to improve downstream processing. 3) Liquid chromatography uses chemical interactions to separate proteins with different chemical properties into multiple samples, called fractions. These fractions are then analyzed with a mass spectrometer. 4) The mass spectrometer produces data that reveals the chemical makeup of each fraction, which can then be 5) analyzed to identify and quantify proteins in each sample.](https://theautomatedlab.com/assets/images/content/workflow-proteomics.png)

#### Common (Automatable) Proteomics Techniques

**Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS or MS/MS)**

Mass spectrometry is the workhorse of proteomics, used to determine the composition of proteins in a sample. In a typical workflow, proteins are digested into peptides and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) enhances the capabilities of LC-MS by further fragmenting peptides for more accurate identification and quantification. Post-translational modifications, which can be of significant interest to labs using proteomics workflows, can be identified and quantified at very low concentrations with these methods. Lab automation can be used to streamline sample preparation, digestion, and data acquisition processes.

**Quantitative Proteomics**

Quantitative proteomics techniques, like stable isotope labeling (SILAC) or isobaric tags (iTRAQ and TMT), make use of mass spectrometry readouts to enable comparison of protein levels across different samples. This process is generally used to characterize cellular response to various factors like treatment response or cell line modifications. Using lab automation ensures accurate peptide labeling, pooling, and data acquisition, which are critical for reliable quantification.

**Immunoprecipitation and Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IPs)**

Immunoprecipitation (IP) uses immobilized antibodies to isolate specific proteins from a mixture. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) extends this technique to study protein-protein interactions by isolating protein complexes. Automation can handle the precise liquid handling and bead or resin washing steps, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

**Multiplexed Immunoassays**

Multiplexed immunoassays are analytical techniques that allow the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple proteins in a single sample. These assays provide a comprehensive view of the protein composition of a sample, enabling a better understanding of disease states, immune responses, and cellular functions. Multiplexed immunoassays are highly efficient, reducing the time, cost, and sample volume needed compared to traditional single-analyte assays. They can be run in a high-throughput format using automated equipment.

#### Common Hardware Components for Proteomics Automation

**Liquid Handlers**

[These robots](https://theautomatedlab.com/article.html?content=liquid-handling-basics) can pipette liquids with high precision and accuracy, handling many tasks from protein isolation through pooling.

**Microplate Readers**

Microplate readers are essential for quantifying proteins and other analytes. Automated systems can integrate these readers with liquid handlers for seamless data collection.

**Chromatography Systems**

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems are used to separate proteins or peptides. Automation can control the injection, fraction collection, and data integration with a mass spectrometer.

**Temperature Control Modules**

Maintaining the correct temperature during sample storage and incubation steps is crucial for many proteomics workflows. Automated systems can include temperature control modules, like automated incubators and refrigerators, to ensure samples are kept at optimal conditions. Some examples of this are on-deck thermal cyclers like the [Inheco ODTC](https://www.inheco.com/odtc.html) or[Thermo ATC](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/pcr/thermal-cyclers-realtime-instruments/thermal-cyclers/automated-thermal-cycler-atc.html), on-deck vendor-integrated heating and cooling blocks, or standalone devices like the [Thermo Cytomat](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/51026519) or [LiCONiC StoreX](https://www.liconic.com/istx.html).

**Bead-Based Purification Systems**

[Kingfisher instruments](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/dna-rna-purification-analysis/automated-purification-extraction/kingfisher-systems.html) use surface-treated magnetic beads to automate the purification of nucleic acids, proteins, and cells, offering high throughput and reproducibility. However, since they don’t have any liquid handling capabilities of their own, they are integrated with liquid handlers that can store and dispense the necessary reagents.

#### Common Challenges

1. Sample Variability: Different sample types (e.g., plasma vs. tissue) introduce significant input variability. Automated workflows need to be adapted to handle this diversity.
2. Protein or Peptide Loss: Binding and elution conditions need to be optimized to minimize sample loss to wash buffers using automated equipment.
3. Labware Incompatibility: Use automation-friendly labware that is compatible with the necessary reagents, as well as the automated systems that will be used.
4. Handling and Storage: Proper handling and storage of samples and reagents before, during, and after an assay run is critical to maintaining the integrity of the experiment.

#### Future Trends in Protein Workflow Automation

**Microfluidics**

Microfluidic devices can handle tiny volumes of liquids down to a femtoliter (fL) scale. This enables extremely high-throughput and low-cost proteomics analyses. These devices are highly integrated and can achieve complex workflows on a single chip.

**Lab-on-a-Chip**

Lab-on-a-chip technology miniaturizes entire laboratory processes, allowing for high-throughput screening and analysis with minimal sample and reagent consumption.

**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**

AI and ML are becoming increasingly important in making sense of the vast amounts of data generated in proteomics. These technologies can optimize workflows, predict outcomes, and analyze complex data sets. Using information generated using ML techniques, experiments can be designed and performed on automated instruments in a more targeted, high-throughput way.

Automating protein capture and labeling workflows offers numerous advantages, from increased throughput and reproducibility to reduced manual labor. However, it requires careful planning, optimization, and maintenance to achieve the best results. As technology advances, automation will continue to play a pivotal role in proteomics, driving new discoveries and innovations in biomedical research.
