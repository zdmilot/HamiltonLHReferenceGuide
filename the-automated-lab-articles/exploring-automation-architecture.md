# Exploring Automation Architecture

Function follows form. The architectural decisions behind your automated lab define its strengths and weaknesses. Let’s dive into the different types of automation architectures and explore the role of centralized systems, individual workcells, and modular systems. Whether you’re a lab manager, a scientist, or just a curious mind, this guide will help you make informed architectural decisions.

#### Centralized Infrastructure: The One-Stop Super Lab

Centralized automation is defined by the interconnectedness and physical proximity of lab equipment and processes. All instruments and workflows are controlled and coordinated from a single point, providing diverse functionality from a composite system.

**Key Features**

Consolidation: All instruments are physically centralized and integrated using robotic arms.

Efficiency: Centralized systems improve the overall efficiency of the lab by reducing instrument downtime.

Accuracy and High Data Quality: Since all workflows run on the same equipment, data generated is more accurate and reproducible across runs. Consolidated data generation allows for quicker and easier data analysis.

Central Scheduling: A single controlling software or custom scheduler coordinates all workflows.

Streamlined Data: Process and analytical data are colocated with system hardware, and potentially funneled into a central database or software suite.

Shared Resources: Labware, tips, and other consumables are stored centrally, optimizing resource availability.

**Advantages**

Consistency and Reproducibility: Since all processes run on the same set of instruments, workflows—and therefore data and workflow outputs—are highly consistent.

Cost and Space Efficiency: Centralizing functions can reduce each device’s idle time and optimize space usage.

Ease of Monitoring: Central systems are easier to monitor during operation, making it simpler to maintain sterility and operational integrity.

Data Integration: Consistent output sources (instruments) allows for easier integration with LIMS systems for sample tracking.

**Challenges**

High Initial Costs: Setting up centralized systems requires significant investment in equipment, full-time employees (FTE), and opportunity cost from delivery and installation timelines.

Complexity and Fragility: Managing a centralized system can be complex, with potential for a single point of failure. In other words, if your central system is down for maintenance, the rest of the lab follows.

Flexibility Constraints: Custom solutions may be harder to implement due to the rigid structure. Once a system is deployed, it is costly and time-consuming to change.

Resource Constraints: Consolidation of resources leads to competition between development and production needs.

#### Individual Workcells: The Specialist Approach

Individual workcells are like specialized departments within the lab, each dedicated to a specific function, such as cell culture, genomics, or proteomics.

**Key Features**

Specialization: Each workcell is tailored for specific tasks and outfitted with the equipment and accessories to achieve those tasks efficiently.

Interconnectedness: Workcells can potentially be connected using mobile robots or shuttles to facilitate collaboration between lab functions and increase instrument usage.

**Advantages**

Flexibility: Workcells can be highly customized for each workflow, making them very adaptable for specialized workflows.

Parallel Processing: Assay development and production can be parallelized, enhancing efficiency in the lab.

Redundancy: If one workcell fails, others can continue operating, reducing downtime.

Scalability: Workcells can be easily scaled up or down as needed.

Cross-Contamination Reduction: Isolated workcells reduce the risk of cross-contamination.

Safety: Safe environments are easier to design and maintain due to segregation of particularly hazardous tasks and materials.

Expertise Development: Teams can develop specialized expertise in specific workcells, improving performance and innovation.

**Challenges**

Space Inefficiency: More workcells mean more lab space is required.

Redundant Costs: Most workcells require many of the same devices, making equipment purchases redundant. It may also be necessary to deploy duplicate workcells in order to improve throughput.

Increased Maintenance: Each workcell requires individual maintenance, making for more equipment maintenance overall.

Performance Inconsistencies: More work is required to eliminate variability in performance across workcells, impacting data quality or maintenance effort.

Data Aggregation: Collecting and analyzing data from multiple sources can be complex.

#### Modular Systems: The Transformers of the Lab

Modular systems can be transformed—they are flexible, adaptable, and designed to change as your needs evolve. Instruments mounted on carts can be attached or detached from an integrated system, allowing for a highly customizable setup.

**Key Features**

Modularity: Systems are designed as a collection of individual units rather than a single workcell.

Flexibility: Equipment on carts can be easily moved and reconfigured. Equipment can be used individually, or integrated to create a new workcell on the fly.

**Advantages**

Customization: Modular systems can be adapted to meet specific needs as they arise.

Scalability: Modules can be added or removed to address capacity requirements.

Incremental Costs: New modules can be added over time, enabling a more linear cost to scale up throughput and functionality.

Space Flexibility: Though modular systems may be bulky, usage of lab space can be optimized by reconfiguring systems as needed.

Standardized Integration: Standard hardware and software interfaces make installation quick and easy.

Reduced Downtime: If one instrument fails, it can be quickly removed or replaced without impacting the whole system.

**Challenges**

Vendor Dependence: Reliance on specific integration vendors for modules and upgrades.

Specialized Costs: High unit costs for specialized carts or hardware.

Complex Workflow Management: Coordinating complex workflows across multiple groups can be challenging with shared equipment.

Each lab automation architecture—centralized automation, individual workcells, and modular systems—offers unique benefits and challenges. Centralized systems provide consistency and efficiency but come with high initial costs and complexity. Individual workcells offer customization and scalability but may require more space and maintenance. Modular systems deliver flexibility and adaptability but can be expensive and complex to manage.

Choosing the right architecture depends on your lab’s specific needs, resources, and goals. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, you can make informed decisions to enhance your lab’s productivity and efficiency. Happy automating!
