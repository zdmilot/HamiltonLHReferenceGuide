# Scheduling Issues - Tips and Tricks

Be mindful of memory usage

* Make sure methods have all unused libraries stripped from the toolbox
* Avoid using smart steps
* Keep Capacities for resource units reasonable – if only 5 deck positions available, do not need to use all 45 incubator positions

Additional views/editors

* Methods, once they have activities have an Activity/Action View which allows some programming options as well – not as powerful as editing within the method
* Graphical workflows are available, but usually aren’t powerful enough for most schedules
