# Hamilton Liquid Verification Kit (LVK)

#### Optimize and Verify Pipetting Performance with Convenience and Ease

Environmental factors such as altitude, temperature, and humidity, combined with varying physical properties such as volume and viscosity, can affect automated liquid handling precision and accuracy. To save time from the standard trial and error of fine-tuning liquid classes, Hamilton Robotics offers the Liquid Verification Kit (LVK) for liquid class development and liquid class verification.

**Refine with Liquid Class Development**

Create and test customized liquid classes that are optimized for your lab’s environment, types of liquids, and volumes pipetted.

**Confirm with Liquid Class Verification**

Verify customized liquid classes to ensure the liquid handling system is within compliance of your lab-defined acceptance criteria. Perform QC of your liquid handling system quarterly, monthly, or even daily as required by your procedures.
