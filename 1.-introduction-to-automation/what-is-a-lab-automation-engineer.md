# What is a Lab Automation Engineer?

The first industrial robot was created in 1937. Car manufacturers have relied on robotics since the 1960s, and industrial automation has been commonplace since the 1980s. In 1990, the Human Genome Project began its 13-year effort to sequence the human genome for the first time.

Lab automation unites recent biotechnology innovation with decades of industrial automation principles and technology. Lab automation engineers use their understanding of machines, [software](https://theautomatedlab.com/article.html?content=automation-software-landscape), and scientific processes to move tedious benchtop workflows onto specialized laboratory robots, freeing up humans to do what they do best: design, create, connect, and innovate.

#### What does a Lab Automation Engineer do?

So what does a Lab Automation Engineer do? That can vary dramatically from lab to lab. While industrial automation has had decades to develop standard practices and expectations, lab automation is still fairly immature. The tools, use cases, customers, and developers of lab automation are constantly changing. The most important skill a Lab Automation Engineer can have is the ability to learn. Fast.

There are a few work environment archetypes a Lab Automation Engineer may encounter. These are:

**Research & Development vs. Manufacturing or Testing**

R\&D environments tend to be dynamic, with processes changing on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. As a Lab Automation Engineer, your job may be more development-oriented, and your solution will need to optimize for flexibility and maintainability. Manufacturing or product-oriented labs may never change their processes once approved, and Lab Automation Engineers may spend more time supporting infrastructure and optimizing systems for increased throughput.

**Clinical vs. Non-Clinical**

The regulatory status of a lab has a significant impact on a Lab Automation Engineer’s role. Clinical labs and other regulated environments will require more focus on documentation, quality control, and development of measurement strategies in order to adhere to regulations. Non-regulated labs are less burdened by external requirements for documentation, which means automation can change more quickly. However, it is up to the automation engineers to hold their team accountable for designing (and documenting) solutions that are maintainable.

**Academia vs. Industry**

It is foolish to generalize what an academic lab looks like, and that’s the point. Industry labs tend to have money for technology, and a high-level goal of decreasing cost while increasing benefit. In these environments, solutions need to be delivered with a clear payoff timeline. By contrast, academic labs may have more diverse goals and less predictable budgets. In these environments scrappiness is queen, and you will have to get to know the lab to understand its needs.

#### How does one become a Lab Automation Engineer?

A common pathway into lab automation is that of the lab technician, research associate, or scientist who works with automated equipment as part of their job. This could be someone that instinctively automates away their more tedious tasks, a routine operator of automated benchtop workflows, or someone who knows the ins and outs of their lab equipment. Because formal training in lab automation is rare and inaccessible, many Lab Automation Engineers find their way into the field through accidental exposure.

Support and troubleshooting is a big part of a Lab Automation Engineer’s day-to-day, which means a career in IT, tech support, or customer service can be excellent training for a career in Lab Automation. People in these roles at biotechnology companies can lean into their customer service and problem-solving skills while building industry knowledge before transitioning into a Lab Automation role.

Jumping from a more traditional engineering field into lab automation is also quite common. software, mechanical, electrical, robotics, and industrial automation engineers each bring expertise in a skillset that is valuable to a lab automation team. Chemical engineers and others with bioengineering expertise may be uniquely suited to lab automation given their strong scientific _and_ engineering foundations.

There is no one way to become a Lab Automation Engineer, which means anyone with an interest in the field and the motivation to learn should feel welcome. Hiring managers should be aware that there are no formal degree programs for lab automation, and that any particular education requirements are poor indicators of a good Lab Automation Engineer. What’s more important is a familiarity with the lab processes relevant to your workplace, competence in technical problem solving, and the ability to pick up new technology quickly.

#### What skills does a Lab Automation Engineer need?

Since formal training is not currently an option for aspiring lab automation engineers, the primary skills a lab automation engineer needs are adaptability and the ability to learn quickly. Technology and work environments are constantly changing, and a lab automation engineer needs to be able to identify, assess, and work with new software or hardware systems on a rolling basis. For development-oriented Lab Automation Engineers, basic requirements gathering and project management skills are essential.

Many of the people you develop automated solutions for will be new to lab automation, which means it’s your job to figure out what a customer needs based on the problems they have. That means talking to users about their processes, being in the lab to see what workflows look like, and figuring out how to deliver the right level of automation based on the available budget and timeline. Development timelines for most lab automation projects range from several weeks to several months. Lab automation engineers often need to handle stakeholder communication, vendor management, development, testing, and handoff.

Troubleshooting, quantitative assessment, and root cause analysis are essential skills for a lab automation engineer in any work environment. Lab automation solutions are often complex or obtuse. Third party software and hardware is often delivered as a “black box”, meaning customers may not have access to meaningful documentation or source code. In order to solve problems on complex systems quickly, a lab automation engineer needs to be able to localize the root cause of a problem so that they can either solve the problem themselves, or reach out to the correct vendor with a specific issue.

Notice that none of the skills listed are technology-specific. As a Lab Automation Engineer, you will learn about the technology and scientific processes that your lab relies on, and iterate from there. A background in biology, chemistry, or engineering can give you a head start, but a Lab Automation Engineer is never done learning.
