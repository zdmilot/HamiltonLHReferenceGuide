# Manual Pipetting vs. Semi-Automation vs. Automation

Both hand pipetting and automation can be used effectively in a lab that is managing liquid samples. The method to choose

depends on the application. See below for some key factors to help you decide which method is best for your application.

## When to Use Manual Pipetting

Hand pipetting is fast in small applications and only requires the hand of a practiced lab tech instead of extra hardware.

While manual pipetting is straightforward, it does introduce risks of technician-to-technician variability.

## When to Use Semi-Automation

Semi-automation offers a way for labs to incrementally scale up production and increase reproducibility through liquid handlers

that automate certain aspects of sample preparation. Instead of a technician manually setting volumes on a pipette or keeping

track of steps in a method, semi-automated liquid handlers (like Hamilton’s Microlab 600) automate those aspects of the work,

only requiring the technician to move a hand probe from vessel to vessel.

## When to Use Automation

Full automation is most valuable in high-throughput applications that benefit from completely removing human movements.

Liquid handling platforms process hundreds of samples at a time and follow highly complex methods without deviation.
