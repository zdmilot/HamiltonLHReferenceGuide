This can be corrected with a power cycle of the device. Ensure power cycling of the device happens after the daily maintenance to avoid this issue see (daily maintenance for more details.
* **SOLUTION 2:** if the vantage z direction is slow durring LLD especially cLLD this could be due to the setting of “speed up liquid level detection” being off. This can be adjusted in the system configuration editor (see system configuration error)
