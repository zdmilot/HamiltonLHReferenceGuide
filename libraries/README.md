# 10. Libraries

A library is a collection of standard functions which the programmer can choose from when writing methods in addition to the toolbox elements. The best-known functions are the mathematical functions. For these, VENUS Software provides a mathematical function library. There are several other libraries that can be found to be useful. If the library required hasnâ€™t been installed yet, install it through "Tools -> Hamilton Support Software...".

To use library functions in a method, include the appropriate library. Follow these steps:

1. Select "Method -> Libraries..." in the Labware Editor to open the dialog seen below.
2.  To add a library, click the Browse Button \[...] at the center of the table highlighted below or click the \[Add Library...] Button.\

3. In the file selection box, select the required library to be imported. Click \[OK].
4. Repeat steps 2 through 4 to import all the libraries needed.
5. Click \[OK] to close the dialog. The selected library functions are available under their own group tab in the toolbox and can be used like standard commands.
6. To remove libraries, select the libraries to be removed and click the \[Remove Library] Button.

VENUS Software supports two kinds of libraries: HSL Libraries (\*.hsl) and Sub-method Libraries (\*.smt).

A library function can also be self-written and can be used like any standard library through the following:

* Graphical Method Editor (to create a Sub-method library)
* HSL Method Editor (to create an HSL library)
