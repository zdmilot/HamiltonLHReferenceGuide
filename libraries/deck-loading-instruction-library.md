This library can be a little complicated to set up but once understood it uses labware IDs and sequences to populate the deck layout with just the labware required for the run and prompt your end user for where they need to load it and what they need to do. It is much more flexible than taking pictures and displaying them in user output boxes as if you decide to rearrange the deck layout later as long as you conserve the labware IDs and sequence names theyâ€™ll work with the new layout.
