# Assay Automation Background and Preparation

Automation can greatly enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and streamline workflows, especially in high-throughput environments like bio banking or analytical laboratories. This guide outlines a step-by-step process to help you get started in lab automation, based on seven key steps.

## Step 1: Map Your Workflow

Understanding your current workflow is critical before automating. Break down each step involved in your lab processes. For example, in a biobanking setting:

* **Sample Reception**: Samples arrive in vials.
* **Processing**: They are centrifuged at a specific speed.
* **Aliquoting**: Samples are divided into a defined number of aliquots.
* **Storage**: The aliquots are stored in a freezer at a specific temperature.

Documenting each step in detail will help you identify where automation could be most beneficial and how each step can be integrated into an automated system.

## Step 2: Identify Repetitive and Error-Prone Tasks

Automation is particularly useful for repetitive tasks prone to human error. Common examples include:

* **Sample Dilution**: Diluting multiple samples with varying dilution factors. Mistakes in dilution steps can easily occur, making this a prime candidate for automation.

Look for tasks that are time-consuming and prone to inconsistency—automating these will have the greatest impact on reducing errors and increasing efficiency.

## Step 3: Determine Your Operational and Technical Requirements

List all the specific requirements your lab processes have:

* **Throughput**: How many samples do you process per day?
* **Sample Stability**: Do your samples need to be temperature controlled?
* **Regulatory Needs**: Do you need to adhere to GXP or IVDR guidelines?
* **Volume Range**: What volume range does your workflow cover (e.g., milliliters, microliters)?
* **Precision & Accuracy**: How accurate do the systems need to be in sample handling?
* **Automation Modules**: Do you need features like temperature control, shaking, or barcode scanning on deck?
* **Lab Space**: How much space is available for new equipment?
* **Consumables**: What specific consumables (e.g., tips, reagents) are compatible with the equipment?
* **Automation Waste**: What specific waste streams do you have and at what quantities for each?&#x20;

Considering these factors will help guide the configuration of the automation solution that best fits your lab's needs.

## Step 4: Conduct Thorough Market Research

Once your needs are clear, it’s important to conduct comprehensive research into the available options. This can include:

* **Websites and Webinars**: Visit vendor websites and attend informational webinars on the latest automation technology.
* **Peer Feedback**: Talk to colleagues who have already implemented automation in similar workflows to get insights on what worked for them.

By reviewing available systems and technologies, you can compare features, benefits, and limitations of different solutions.

## Step 5: Decide Whether to Automate Part or All of the Workflow

Sometimes, automating the entire workflow may not be necessary. Focus first on automating the most repetitive and error-prone tasks. For instance:

* **Partial Automation**: Automate aliquoting and dilutions but leave other tasks, like sample labeling, manual.
* **Full Automation**: If the entire process is time-sensitive or subject to errors, consider automating the entire workflow from start to finish.

Assess which parts of your workflow would benefit most from automation and which can remain manual without sacrificing efficiency or accuracy.

## Step 6: Book a Demo with Your Preferred Partner(s)

After narrowing down your options through research, reach out to potential automation vendors for a demonstration of their products. This will give you a hands-on look at how the system works in practice and help you assess if it meets your needs. When booking a demo, ensure you:

* Share your workflow requirements.
* Ask specific questions about customization, integration, and scalability.
* Explore how well the system matches your technical and operational needs.

## Step 7: Identify the Level of Support and Cost

Finally, it’s essential to evaluate the level of support that comes with your chosen automation system:

* **Technical Support**: Will the vendor provide ongoing support for troubleshooting and maintenance?
* **Training**: Will they offer training for your team to effectively use the system?
* **Service Contracts**: Understand the cost of service contracts and any potential hidden fees for repairs or upgrades.

Each vendor's level of support can vary significantly, and this factor can play a large role in the long-term success of your automation system.
