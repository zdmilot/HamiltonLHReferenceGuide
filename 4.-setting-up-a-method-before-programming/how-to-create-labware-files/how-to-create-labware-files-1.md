# Labware Categories

To be able to group the labware in the selection tree of the System Deck Editor, each labware has to be assigned to a labware category first. For the labware that comes with the default installation, this has been done already.

However, in creating an own new labware, connection should be done manually.

1. Open the Labware Editor where the rack or template has been created.
2. Choose the category where the rack or template will be linked to and click \[Assigned Category].\

3. The category is displayed in the “Assigned Labware Category” Field shown in the image above. Assigning a labware for more than one category can be done. For instance, a 96-well Deep Well Plate can be in the category “Plates  96 Position Plates” and in the “Deep Well Plates” Category.
4. In order to apply the changes into the software, update the labware category index. Select “Generate Labware Category Index” in the Labware Editor, as shown below.\
