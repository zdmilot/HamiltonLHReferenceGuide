<table><thead><tr><th width="193">Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Swap Speed</strong></td><td>The speed at which the system exchanges air with liquid during aspiration or dispensing. This "swap" typically happens at the boundary between air and liquid inside the pipette tip or syringe.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Low-level step</strong></td><td>An instrument-specific command (e.g., Aspirate, Dispense, etc.).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pipette step</strong></td><td>Aspirate and/or dispense step.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TADM</strong></td><td>Total aspiration and dispensing monitoring. A system used in automated liquid handling to monitor the pressure inside individual pipetting channels during aspiration and dispensing. By generating pressure-time curves, it ensures the accuracy and safety of pipetting processes. The system detects errors such as clogs, leaks, or insufficient liquid volume by comparing the pressure data against predefined tolerance bands, providing real-time feedback and error prevention during liquid handling operations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TADM tolerance band</strong></td><td>Upper and lower limits, which have been computed from a statistically significant amount of measurements.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TADM curve</strong></td><td>Measured TADM pressure progression during a pipette step.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Flow rates</strong> and <strong>Mix flow rates</strong></td><td>Volume flows of liquid in μl/s; they correspond to plunger speeds for aspirating, dispensing, and mixing.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Air transport volume</strong></td><td>Air for transport is aspirated at the end of the aspirate step and automatically dispensed again as an extra volume in the first part of the dispense step.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Blowout volume</strong></td><td>Blow-out air is taken up first during aspiration if dispensing will later be done using the "empty tip" dispense mode. In the dispense step, the entire volume including blow-out air is dispensed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Swap speed</strong></td><td>The speed at which the dispensing head is drawn up out of the liquid.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Settling time</strong></td><td>The time the dispensing head has to wait in the liquid after aspiration/dispensing until it begins to withdraw.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Over-aspirate volume</strong></td><td>A kind of pre-wetting volume: on aspirating e.g. 20μl of liquid, first more than 20μl is aspirated (20μl + Over Asp. Vol.), so as to pre-wet the tip. Then this volume is immediately dispensed again (still in the aspirate step).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Clot retract height</strong></td><td>A parameter for recognizing blood clots, which determines how high the dispensing head is allowed to travel up out of the liquid if there is a residual cLLD signal after aspiration. It is measured in mm from the height of the liquid surface upwards. If this distance is exceeded, an error message is generated.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stop flow rate</strong></td><td>The dispensing speed of the plunger (expressed as a stream of liquid volume in μl/s), at which the dispensing step terminates abruptly. If "dispense flow rate" is equal to "stop flow rate", the dispense breaks off abruptly after dispensing the volume without slowing down beforehand. If “Stop flow rate” is equal to zero, the plunger movement becomes gradually slower during the dispense until it stops.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stop back volume</strong></td><td>Volume which is aspirated again immediately after the dispense (as part of the dispense step). This volume is aspirated automatically as quickly as possible.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jet empty tip</strong></td><td>Set this mode if all liquid within the tip shall be dispensed at once. A defined amount of blow-out air is used to make sure that all liquid is dispensed from the tip.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jet part volume</strong></td><td>Set this mode if only a part volume within the tip shall be dispensed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Surface empty tip</strong></td><td>Set this mode if all liquid within the tip shall be dispensed at once. A defined amount of blow-out air is used to make sure that all liquid is dispensed from the tip.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Surface part volume</strong></td><td>Set this mode if only a part volume within the tip shall be dispensed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
