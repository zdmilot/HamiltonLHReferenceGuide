# 1. Introduction to Automation

## Liquid handling

liquid handling refers to the automated processes used in laboratories to precisely measure, transfer, and dispense small volumes of liquids.

lab automation, specifically liquid handling, refers to the use of robotic systems to automate the process of handling and manipulating liquids, such as pipetting, dispensing, and mixing, in laboratory settings.

These systems:

* enable precise and efficient transfer of liquids
* reduce manual labor and minimize errors
* are commonly used in applications like high-throughput screening, pcr setup, and sample preparation.

liquid handling systems utilize robotic arms, pumps, and specialized tips to automate repetitive liquid transfer tasks across various laboratory applications.

## Liquid Handlers

Liquid handlers are automated robotic systems used to precisely dispense and transfer small volumes of liquids in laboratories. they are particularly useful for:

* automating repetitive liquid handling tasks like serial dilutions, reagent additions, sample transfers etc. This increases throughput, reproducibility and frees up researchers' time. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid\_handling\_robot)
* handling large numbers of samples and liquid transfers that would be tedious and error-prone if done manually. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid\_handling\_robot)
* performing complex liquid handling protocols with high accuracy and precision, reducing human error and contamination risks. [2](https://www.promegaconnections.com/exploring-instrumentation-for-your-lab-particle-movers-vs-liquid-handlers/)
* integrating with other lab equipment like microplate readers, centrifuges, incubators etc. to automate entire workflows. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid\_handling\_robot)
* handling hazardous or infectious liquids with minimal human exposure. [2](https://www.promegaconnections.com/exploring-instrumentation-for-your-lab-particle-movers-vs-liquid-handlers/)
* applications like PCR setup, ELISA, nucleic acid extraction, next-gen sequencing library prep where consistent liquid transfers are critical. [5](https://www.aurorabiomed.com/beginners-guide-to-understanding-automated-liquid-handling/)

The key advantages of liquid handlers are their ability to pipette extremely small volumes (micro/nanoliters) with high reproducibility, perform high-throughput liquid transfers rapidly, integrate accessory modules for automated workflows, and provide sample traceability.
