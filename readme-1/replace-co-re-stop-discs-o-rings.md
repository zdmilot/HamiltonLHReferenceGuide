    **The Prep includes an** [**animation describing how to replace stop discs and o-rings**](https://youtu.be/ZKEqizAciqI)**.** The tutorial animations are available in the Tutorials tab of the Prep’s settings page.

    1. **Make sure to wear appropriate PPE for your lab**.
    2. **Turn on the Prep** if it is not already on. Sign in if required.
    3. **Tap the settings button** with the gear icon at the top-right corner of the home page.
    4. **Open the Instrument tab and select Maintenance**.
    5. **Select the required stop disc replacement routine.** Each channel has its own routine, as well as the 8-channel MPH.
    6. **Open the door, clear the deck, then close the door.** The Prep will move the appropriate pipetting tool into position for replacing its stop disc(s) and o-ring(s).
    7. **Use the stop disc removal tool to unscrew the old stop disc**, along with its o-ring and washer. The tool has two small prongs that fit into notches on the stop disc; the tool can only twist one way to remove the stop disc.\

    8. **Apply glue to 2–3 threads on the new stop disc.** Do not remove the stop disc from its rubber strip yet—if glue gets on the washer or o-ring or inside the stop disc, the stop disc will have to be replaced.
    9. **Pull the new stop disc out of its rubber strip.** Twisting the stop disc may help to remove it.
    10. **Make sure the o-ring and washer are properly attached and aligned on the new stop disc. Inspect and ensure all eight stop disks on the multi-probe head are at the same height.** The o-ring should rest between the top of the stop disc and the washer. Double-check that the washer and o-ring are glue-free before proceeding.
    11. **Screw the new stop disc onto the pipetting head or multi-probe head by hand.** The washer may need to be adjusted so it rests flat on the o-ring. Make sure the stop disc goes on straight to avoid cross-threading it on the pipetting head.
    12. Do not use any tools to tighten the stop disc, or you may damage the pipetting head and have to replace it.
    13. **Clean the new stop disc** with a clean, lint-free towel sprayed with deionized water.
    14. **Repeat steps 7–12 as necessary.** All eight stop-discs on the multi-probe head must be replaced. The front and rear pipetting head only have one stop disc each, but they should be replaced at the same time for consistent performance.
    15. **Close the door when prompted.** The Prep will start the calibration procedure for the new stop discs and o-rings.
    16. **When prompted, open the door and place tips on site 7.** If your Prep has channels only, you willl need two tips in positions A1 and B1. Otherwise, you will need a full column of tips in column A. Specify which tips you loaded onscreen, then tap Next.
    17. **Close the door and wait until calibration is finished.** You can remove the tips once calibration is finished.
