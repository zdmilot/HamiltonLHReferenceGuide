# Pipette Calibration

Pipette calibration is the process of ensuring the accuracy and precision of a pipette's liquid volume delivery by measuring its performance and adjusting it accordingly.

### Artel PCS® Pipette Calibration System

Ensure data integrity, reliable test results, and regulatory compliance.

Easily calibrate pipettes, perform interim verifications, standardise operator skills, manage pipette inventory, and more with the Artel PCS® Pipette Calibration System.\
Fast, accurate, and precise, the PCS is a portable and easy-to-use volume verification system that simplifies single-channel pipette calibration, interim volume verification, and pipette user/operator training and competency assessment. Paired with the included [PCS Software](https://www.techno-path.com/uk/product/pcs-software-2/), the PCS helps you stay on top of your pipette inventory with calibration and interim verification scheduling, email notifications, pipette and pipette operator status, and comprehensive, auditable documentation. Easily meet both external regulatory requirements and internal quality standards to ensure data quality.

The power of the PCS stems from the ratiometric photometry technology and standardised dye solutions that are used to measure dispensed volumes. The system is robust against differences in environmental conditions and calibration results are traceable to NIST standards, enabling straightforward comparison of pipettes, operators, methods, and locations.

## Hamilton Liquid Verification Kit ([see LVK](../performance-characteristics/hamilton-liquid-verification-kit-lvk.md))

#### Optimize and Verify Pipetting Performance with Convenience and Ease

Environmental factors such as altitude, temperature, and humidity, combined with varying physical properties such as volume and viscosity, can affect automated liquid handling precision and accuracy. To save time from the standard trial and error of fine-tuning liquid classes, Hamilton Robotics offers the Liquid Verification Kit (LVK) for liquid class development and liquid class verification.

**Refine with Liquid Class Development**

Create and test customized liquid classes that are optimized for your lab’s environment, types of liquids, and volumes pipetted.

**Confirm with Liquid Class Verification**

Verify customized liquid classes to ensure the liquid handling system is within compliance of your lab-defined acceptance criteria. Perform QC of your liquid handling system quarterly, monthly, or even daily as required by your procedures.
