# Select an instrument

If more than one ML STAR instrument was defined you can changed the instrument. This functionality can be carry out too if the application with the necessary [Comand Line Parameters](maintenance-or-verification-command-line-parameters.md) is started. Furthermore a new connection to the instrument can be forced with that.
