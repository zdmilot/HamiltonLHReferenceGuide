1. **Open the door and inspect the tip eject sleeves and o-rings on the 1000uL pipetting Channels and the CO-RE 96 or 384.** The tip eject sleeves should move up and down freely, and the stop discs should be undamaged and aligned with the tip eject sleeves.\

2. **Inspect the deck.** Make sure the following components are secure and undamaged:

* Corner brackets
* Calibration post
* Waste block
* Liquid waste bottles
* Hamilton Heater Shaker, or the cover for the device connector

3. **Empty the waste bin and any liquid waste.** Clean the waste bin and liquid waste bottle according to your laboratory’s procedures.

* **Spray a clean, lint-free towel with deionized water and wipe down the pipetting tools' stop discs and tip eject sleeves.** Lift the tip eject sleeves to expose the stop discs and o-rings.\
  \
  NOTE: Only use distilled water to clean O-rings

2. **Apply a small amount of silicone oil to the lead screw.** Use a lint-free cotton swab to apply the oil. Do not apply more than a couple drops, as excess dripping oil could contaminate the Prep.
3. **Close the door when finished with the front channel.** The Prep will position the rear channel for cleaning.
4. **Repeat steps 2–4 for the rear channel.** Note that its lead screw is located to the right of the tip eject sleeve.\
