* If a bulk product is dispensed to barcoded tubes and tracking is required:
  * Barcode text file may provide sufficient outgoing information.
  * Generate mapping files for more detailed information on barcodes and volumes.

## Example: Worklist Substitutions

* For Plates, barcodes can replace Labware ID&#x20;
  * Also for position ID - bottom labeled 96 tube racks are possible, EasyCode device -> 2d array of BCâ€™s
* For Tubes, Barcodes can replace both the Position ID and Labware ID
