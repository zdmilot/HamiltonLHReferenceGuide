# Creating a New Method



1.  When started, the application appears as the image shown below:

2.  To create a method, click on the “ ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>) ” Icon found on the tool bar or select “File -> New -> Method” as shown in the image below.

3.  A selection dialog appears as shown in the image below.

4.  Select “Methods“ and type a file name for the first method, then click the \[Save] Button. The new method is saved and the step editor window will be displayed:

5.  To switch to other views like the “Deck Layout” or the “Action Editor”, use the quick link icons found on the toolbar.\

    \*This icon leads to the action editor if the Microlab STAR scheduling software is not installed. When the scheduling software is installed, this icon will lead to the activity editor.



At this point, only an empty method and deck layout have been created. This is the base for the first method. Now, the newly created environment has to be extended by the labware, sequences, pipetting steps, etc.

The empty deck must be filled with labware and carriers according to the real instrument deck. Adding labware and carriers onto the deck layout is easy (refer to Adding Labware on[ ](file:///Users/zdmilot/Downloads/VENUS%20four%20Programmers%20Manual-2.html#bookmark157)the Deck). The deck layout contains all geometrical information the instrument requires for the pipetting and plate handling steps.

Once the real instrument deck has been mapped in the software deck layout, the method is then prepared for programming (refer to How to Create a Method) for further details.

In the programming phase, the programmer will add steps to the step editor or add actions to the action editor view. Adding a step or adding an action will both prompt a user dialog to request the necessary values for the instrument.
