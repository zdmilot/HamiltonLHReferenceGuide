This section provides information about labware handling using the CO-RE gripper.&#x20;

The CO-RE gripper transports the following to and from positions on the deck of the ML STAR:&#x20;

• Microplates&#x20;

• Covers of microplates&#x20;

• Archive plates&#x20;

• Filter plates&#x20;

• Manifold top of the BVS / CVS system&#x20;



Plates can be gripped in landscape or portrait format within the working area. Rotation of plates is not an option and no process control - checking whether plates are gripped or not - is integrated in the software. An additional “Plate Turning Station” can be used to rotate a plate.&#x20;

The CO-RE gripper consists of two gripping “jaws” that are held by two neighboring pipetting channels of the ML STAR. The pipetting channels can be freely selected. The “Traverse height” of the pipetting channels with the gripping jaws is the same as with the tips: 145mm above the deck.&#x20;

Given that there is no torque sensor at work here, ensure that the CO-RE gripper does not grip plates too tightly. The distance between the jaws that is specified for gripping should be smaller than the length or width of the plate.&#x20;
