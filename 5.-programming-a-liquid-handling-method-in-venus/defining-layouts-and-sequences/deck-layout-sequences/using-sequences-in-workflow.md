# Using Sequences in Workflow

## **Dragging and Dropping Sequences**

Sequences are a powerful tool in managing labware and instrument decks. One of the most efficient ways to use them is through the drag-and-drop feature. This section outlines how to drag and drop sequences into input fields and the use of keyboard shortcuts for smoother operations.

**Steps for Dragging and Dropping Sequences:**

1. **Select the Sequence:**
   * Open the deck view where your sequences are listed.
   * Locate the sequence you want to use from the list of user-defined or default sequences.
2. **Initiate Dragging:**
   * Click and hold the sequence name with the mouse. Ensure that you keep the mouse button pressed.
3. **Move the Sequence:**
   * While holding the sequence, drag it toward the input field where you want to use it.
4. **Dropping the Sequence:**
   * Release the mouse button when you hover over the input field. The sequence will be dropped into the desired input location.

**Using Keyboard Shortcuts:**

* **CTRL for Precise Input:**
  * To maintain precision when moving a sequence, press and hold the `CTRL` key while dragging the sequence.
  * This will ensure the sequence input follows the correct path, especially useful when managing multiple input fields.
* **Keyboard Navigation:**
  * You can also use the `TAB` key to move between input fields, reducing the need for the mouse. Once the correct field is highlighted, drag the sequence into the active field.

## **Tools and Features for Sequence Management**

Deck sequence management is enhanced with several built-in tools that help you organize, modify, and manage your sequences effectively.

**The Stamp Tool:**

The Stamp Tool allows you to replicate a sequence of positions or steps across the instrument deck. This is especially helpful when you need uniform or repeated steps for different labware or processes.

* **Accessing the Stamp Tool:**
  * Open the ‘Stamp Tool Panel’ from the toolbar or menu options.
  * Select the sequence you want to replicate.
  * Use the tool to "stamp" the sequence across multiple input fields or steps.
* **Benefits of the Stamp Tool:**
  * Speeds up sequence replication.
  * Ensures consistency across multiple steps.
  * Simplifies managing complex workflows.

**Clear Selected:**

The 'Clear Selected' option is useful when you need to clear all active sequence selections quickly.

* **How to Use Clear Selected:**
  * If you have multiple sequences selected, click on the 'Clear Selected' button to remove all active selections in the instrument view.
  * This option helps to avoid confusion when switching between different sequences.

**Advanced Options:**

The 'Advanced...' feature allows you to customize sequence positions and sorting with more control.

* **Accessing Advanced Options:**
  * Select a sequence and click on 'Advanced...' from the toolbar.
  * The 'Edit Positions Dialog' will open, giving you detailed sorting and adjustment controls.
  * You can reorder positions, adjust offsets, and fine-tune the sequence layout.
* **Editing System-Defined Sequences:**
  * System-defined sequences can only be viewed in the 'Edit Positions Dialog.' These sequences are read-only, meaning you cannot modify them.
  * Double-click on a system sequence to view it in the dialog box.

## **Deleting Sequences**

Managing sequences often requires deleting obsolete or incorrect sequences. While user-defined sequences can be deleted, system-managed sequences are protected to maintain workflow integrity.

**Steps to Delete User-Defined Sequences:**

1. **Select the Sequence:**
   * From the sequence list, click on the user-defined sequence you wish to delete.
2. **Click Delete:**
   * Use the ‘Delete’ button in the toolbar or press the `Del` key on your keyboard.
3. **Confirm Deletion:**
   * A confirmation dialog will appear, asking if you're sure you want to delete the sequence. Confirm the deletion.
4. **Optional Shortcut:**
   * You can also right-click on the sequence and select 'Delete' from the context menu if that method feels quicker.

**Important Notes:**

* **System-Managed Sequences Cannot Be Deleted:**
  * System-generated sequences are essential for the functioning of the deck management system. As such, they cannot be deleted, renamed, or modified.
  * Trying to delete a system-managed sequence will prompt an error or be disabled entirely.

By following these steps and utilizing the available tools, managing sequences in workflows becomes intuitive, efficient, and scalable.
