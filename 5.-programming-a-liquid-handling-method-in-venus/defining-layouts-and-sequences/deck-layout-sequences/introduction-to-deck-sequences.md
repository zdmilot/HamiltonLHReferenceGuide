# Introduction to Deck Sequences

## **What is a Deck Sequence?**

A **deck sequence** refers to an ordered arrangement of labware or instruments on the deck. These sequences dictate the specific positioning of various tools, containers, or plates on the instrument deck, ensuring precise execution of automated workflows.

In the context of labware and instrument decks:

*   **Labware** includes items like plates, tubes, and reservoirs that are positioned on the deck for use in experiments or assays.\

*   **Instrument decks** are flat surfaces on robotic platforms where labware is placed for automated handling, manipulation, and processing.\

A **deck sequence** determines the order and arrangement in which the labware is processed. These sequences are critical for defining how the automation system interacts with the labware to perform tasks like pipetting, mixing, heating, or cooling.

**Why are Deck Sequences Used?**

Deck sequences are utilized to ensure:

* **Reproducibility**: By defining the exact placement of labware and instruments on the deck, experiments can be reliably repeated with consistent results.
* **Efficiency**: Automated systems perform tasks faster and with fewer errors when labware and tools are positioned systematically.
* **Precision**: Ensures that operations, such as liquid handling or temperature control, are performed in the right order, on the correct labware, without manual intervention.

In addition, sequences streamline workflows by reducing the complexity involved in manually setting up instruments and labware. Automated systems can execute predefined sequences, reducing the chances of human error and increasing throughput.

## **Purpose of Deck Sequences**

**Overview of How Deck Sequences Contribute to Workflow Automation**

Deck sequences are an essential element in laboratory automation as they provide the blueprint for:

* **Task Execution**: Sequences define the steps in which an automated instrument interacts with the labware. Whether the system needs to transfer liquids, incubate samples, or perform complex analysis, the deck sequence ensures the operations happen in the right order.
* **Automated Workflow Management**: In an automated environment, deck sequences ensure that tasks proceed in a logical, predefined manner, allowing users to initiate complex experiments with a few simple commands. This reduces the need for manual intervention and allows laboratories to run unattended processes with minimal risk.
* **Resource Allocation**: By determining the exact layout of labware on the instrument deck, sequences enable efficient use of available resources. For example, a deck sequence can be designed to maximize the number of plates processed at once, improving throughput.

**Importance of Sequences in System Management and User-Defined Operations**

* **System-Managed Sequences**: System-managed sequences are automatically generated and maintained by the automation system. These sequences are critical to ensure that certain functions are always executed in a standard, reliable way. For example, system-defined sequences might include steps to handle calibration or sample initialization. These sequences cannot be modified by users, ensuring the integrity of the core operations of the system.
* **User-Defined Sequences**: Users can define custom deck sequences based on their specific experimental needs. These sequences give users flexibility to adjust the workflow, add new steps, or rearrange labware to accommodate unique protocols. For example, a user might create a custom sequence for a new assay that requires different labware positioning from the default.

**Key Benefits of Using Deck Sequences in Laboratory Automation:**

* **Consistency**: By using deck sequences, the same experiment can be performed multiple times with minimal variation, ensuring consistency in data collection and results.
* **Scalability**: Deck sequences allow users to scale up experiments by automating repetitive tasks, reducing the manual effort required and allowing scientists to focus on data analysis rather than task execution.
* **Customization**: While system-managed sequences ensure standard operation, user-defined sequences provide flexibility, allowing the automation system to be adapted to new workflows or experimental setups.

By managing the layout of the instrument deck and the order of operations, deck sequences are integral to ensuring that automated laboratory systems perform efficiently, accurately, and consistently.
