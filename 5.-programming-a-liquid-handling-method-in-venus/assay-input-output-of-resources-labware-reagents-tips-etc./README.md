# Assay Input/Output of Resources (Labware, Reagents, Tips, etc.)

## Plate hoteling, entry/exit for plates

### Entry/exit for tips

## Liquid waste

### from plates

* liquid handler moving liquid to waste\
  Advanages: Less complex method, no need for device interfacing, no need to rinse plate washer, works on systems without plate washers, no need to worry about cross contamination, no need to worry about issues with device utilization (cannot use the device for the time while it is aspirating liquid), can use the pipetting arm whenever there is downtime in the assay, plates can be hoteled/stakced for easy cycling through plate waste\
  \
  Disadvantages: Utilizes tip consumales although this can be reduced if tips are reused/one set of tips is for waste removal although these tips would have to be monitored and made sure that any wicking or residual voluemes do not cause over aspiration into the pipetting channels, utilizes the pipetting arm which may need to be in use for other parts of the assay, needs a liquid waste disposal add on to be able to handle large volumes of liquid as large volumes cannot go into the tips bin, uses up deck positions for the tips needed and for the plate aspiration steps\

  plate washer aspirating liquid to waste\
  Advantages: Generally rapid and simple removal of lquids, waste is handled by default and no additional harware other than the plate washer is nessesary, allows a single steam of waste, allows for self cleaning of tips, no worries of over aspiration into the pipetting channels, reduces burden on pipetting arm and allows for other tasks to be done in that time\
  \
  Disadvantages: hardware might not be installed, requires interfacing with an aditional device if not used within the assay, some risks of contamination are present although washing the plate washer between washing steps is recomented anyway, additional reagent waste might be used as the probes on the aspiration head might need to get cleaned more often\


### Liquid waste from tubes/reagent waste

* needs to be pipetted by pipetting arm and then output into the liquid hander waste module, gnerally tubes cannot be piced up by the gripper which leads to user intervention to clear out any remaining tubes on the deck.
