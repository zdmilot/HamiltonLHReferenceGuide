# Dead Volume

Dead volume is the amount of volume which is needed to be left behind and not pipetted in a specific labware. This has to be the remaining volume let after all pipetting has been accomplished.

Dead volumes can easily be calculated if the geometry of the labware is known. If you find where the 2mm mark is this is generally a good rule of thumb for the dead volume of a reagent carrier.&#x20;

For PCR plates this level is signifigantly decreesed, as more volue is accessable due to the conical (cone-like shape) of the bottom. The dead volume in these is lower than the cLLD detection height of 2mm but this still needs to be taken into account when programming your runs. When using less than 2mm of height in your labware ensure you are not relying on cLLD detection for precice volumetric measurments.



Minimum dead volume for Hamilton reagent containers is generally \~1% of total volume.

This amount may vary depending on the immersion depth in the aspiration, the volume to be aspirated and the liquid type.&#x20;
