# Choosing the Right Dispense Mode

The dispense mode controls how the liquid is released from the tip. There are two categories of dispense, jet and surface, with a few customizations for each category. Use the chart below to determine which mode to use for your application then read about each mode on the following page.

## Jet Dispense

When set to a jet dispense mode, liquid from the tip is released from above the liquid level. Jet dispense is useful for keeping the tips out of the liquid already present in the well or tube. When using jet dispense, make sure to properly set the dispense height, flow rate, and blowout volume to prevent foam as a result of dispensing. Also, keep in mind that jet dispense isn’t effective for high viscosity liquids.

### Jet Dispense Empty Tip

Empty the entire contents of the tip above the liquid level or into an empty container

_When to Use_

* _Pipetting higher volumes into empty containers_
* _Re-using tips and cannot touch liquid already present_

### Jet Dispense Part Volume

Dispense partial amount of the volume in the tip above the liquid level or into an empty container.

When to Use&#x20;

* Multi-dispensing is required into empty containers or when the tips cannot touch liquid already present

## Surface Dispense

When set to a surface dispense mode, liquid from the tip is released at the liquid’s surface or below the liquid level. Surface dispense is useful for all volumes of liquid, especially small volumes of 20 μL or less. High viscosity liquids need to be dispensed using surface dispense. When using surface dispense, make sure to properly calibrate the other liquid handling settings to prevent bubbles and get accurate volumes.&#x20;

* Be cautious when you use air transport volume. Any air in the transport volume can cause a bubble to form during dispensing.&#x20;
* Use a blowout volume on aspiration, but not on dispense for low volumes. The air can help minimize the capillary effect.

### Surface Dispense Empty Tip

Empty the entire contents of the tip into the liquid.&#x20;

When to Use&#x20;

* Optimal performance is required&#x20;
* Pipetting low volumes&#x20;
* Mixing is required during the dispense step&#x20;



### Surface Dispense Part Volume&#x20;

Dispense partial amount of the volume in the tip into the liquid.&#x20;

When to Use

* Multi-dispensing is required into liquid filled containers and re-use of tips is acceptable
* Pipetting via multi-dispensing is normally is done by jet part dispense mode. However, if the target containers are empty and there’s no risk of cross-contamination, surface part dispense can be used to dispense small amounts of liquid to the bottom of the container that tend to adhere to the tip.
