# Tip Counting Library

The tip counting library provides all functions to store the available amount of tips for following methods. This is useful if a method does not use up all tips on the deck. After a new start of a method, the instrument will continue using the next available tip.

The “TipCount” Prefix has been removed for a better overview.
