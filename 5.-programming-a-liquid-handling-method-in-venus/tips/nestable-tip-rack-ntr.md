# Nestable Tip Rack (NTR)

The Nestable Tip Rack (NTR) is designed to stack disposable tip racks which increase the amount of disposable tips by factor 4 per SBS position compared to one layer tip locations. NTRs come with 5 stacks of 4 layers each and have to be placed onto NTR Carriers of the ML STAR instrument.\

Tip pick up directly from loaded NTR Carriers is basically possible. This eliminates the need for intermediate tip pickup positions since pipetting tools such as single 1000ul pipetting channels as well as MultiProbeHeads (MPH 96 and MPH 384) can pick up tips from the NTR stack in most cases.

A transport system (e.g. iSwap, CO-RE Gripper) is required to remove and dispose empty NTR frames away from NTR Stacks to allow access with the Pipetting Tools to the next lower layer with filled NTRs.

Forcing Pipetting Tools to go down to lower or to the lowest layer of the NTR stack may have limitations due to the required space between the Pipetting Tool and the neighbouring Carriers as well as its corresponding labware (also to other stacks, neighbour NTRâ€™s, etc.). In these cases, an intermediate Tip pick up position becomes necessary. This intermediate tip pickup position is designed and available as an NTR MFX Module (MultiFlexModule, MULTIFLEX NTR 96 MODULE, and MULTIFLEX NTR 384 MODULE).

The transport system as mentioned above must then be used to move NTRs to these intermediate Tip Pickup positions which enable constant tip pickup conditions in terms of the same X, Y and Z coordinates of a single NTR. Once the Tips out of the NTR frame of the intermediate tip pickup position are used up, the frame needs to be replaced by a new filled NTR.

When single-, row- or column wise Tip pickup is required with MultiProbeHeads, an additional tip pickup position equipped with a Tip adapter becomes necessary. The tip adapter may be positioned onto a Tip Rack Carrier as well as on a MFX Tip Module (MULTIFLEX TIP MODULE).

The recommended workflow would be:

1. Transportation of one NTR from a loaded NTR Carrier to the intermediate Tip pickup position
2. Tip pickup with MPH out of the intermediate Tip pickup position
3. Tip eject into the Tip adapter
4. As desired; single-, row- or column wise (shifted) Tip pickup out of the Tip adapter
5. Ready for pipetting

Working with the CO-RE 96 Probe Head and Nestable Tip Racks will need some precautions:

There is danger of collision when the CO-RE 96 Probe Head is picking up tips from lower positions if the neighboring positions are completely filled:\

In this case, either work from top to bottom over all stacks or transport the Nestable Tip Rack to a collision free position and pick up the tips there.
