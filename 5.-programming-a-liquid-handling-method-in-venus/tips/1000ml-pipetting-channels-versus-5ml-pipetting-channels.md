# 1000μl-Pipetting Channels versus 5ml-Pipetting Channels

Working with the 5ml-pipetting channel on the ML STAR is almost the same as working with 1000 μl-pipetting channels. The same CO-RE technology (in a different size) is used to pick up tips and tools, cLLD and pLLD can be performed and the same pipetting features (TADM, MAD, ADC) as on the 1000μl-pipetting channels are available on the 5ml-pipetting channels.&#x20;

However, although the familiar appearance of the Single Steps and Easy Steps for the 5ml-pipetting channel are kept the same, there are some differences to keep in mind when working with the 5ml-pipetting channel.

## Pipetting: 5ml-Pipetting Channel Pattern

Due to its large capacity, the 5ml-pipetting channel needs more space on the y-rail. Therefore, the closest distance from one tip end to the neighbor tip end is 18 mm (this is true if the pipetting channels are mounted on a double rail arm. On a single rail arm, the distance is 36 mm). This has an influence on the sequence, for example, on plates.&#x20;

Using the stamp tool for the 5ml-pipetting channel, a sequence on a plate will look like this:&#x20;

This means that four 5ml-pipetting channels can work in parallel on a landscape plate.

## Pipetting: Well / Tube Diameter

Depending of the immersion depth, the 5ml-pipetting channel may collide with well or tube walls. See image guide below for useable diameters and heights to avoid hardware crashes.
